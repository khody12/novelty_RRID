    "abstract_text": "Abstract This book combines mathematical models with extensive use of epidemiological and other data, to achieve a better understanding of the overall dynamics of populations of pathogens or parasites and their human hosts. The authors thus provide an analytical framework for evaluating public health strategies aimed at controlling or eradicating particular infections. With rising concern for programmes of primary health care against such diseases as measles, malaria, river blindness, sleeping sickness, and schistosomiasis in developing countries, and the advent of HIV/AIDS and other `emerging viruses', such a framework is increasingly important. Throughout, the mathematics is used as a tool for thinking clearly about fundamental and applied problems relating to infectious diseases. The book is divided into two major parts, one dealing with microparasites (viruses, bacteria, and protozoans) and the other with macroparasites (helminths and parasitic arthropods). Each part begins with simple models, developed in a biologically intuitive way, and then goes on to develop more complicated and realistic models as tools for public health planning. A major contribution by two of the leaders in the field, this book synthesizes previous work in this rapidly growing area with much new material, combining work scattered between the ecological and medical literature.",

    "abstract_text": "The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) continues to view with concern the lean pipeline for novel therapeutics to treat drug-resistant infections, especially those caused by gram-negative pathogens. Infections now occur that are resistant to all current antibacterial options. Although the IDSA is encouraged by the prospect of success for some agents currently in preclinical development, there is an urgent, immediate need for new agents with activity against these panresistant organisms. There is no evidence that this need will be met in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we remain concerned that the infrastructure for discovering and developing new antibacterials continues to stagnate, thereby risking the future pipeline of antibacterial drugs. The IDSA proposed solutions in its 2004 policy report, \"Bad Bugs, No Drugs: As Antibiotic R&D Stagnates, a Public Health Crisis Brews\", and recently issued a \"Call to Action\" to provide an update on the scope of the problem and the proposed solutions. A primary objective of these periodic reports is to encourage a community and legislative response to establish greater financial parity between the antimicrobial development and the development of other drugs. Although recent actions of the Food and Drug Administration and the 110th US Congress present a glimmer of hope, significant uncertainly remains. Now, more than ever, it is essential to create a robust and sustainable antibacterial research and development infrastructure\u2014one that can respond to current antibacterial resistance now and anticipate evolving resistance. This challenge requires that industry, academia, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Department of Defense, and the new Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority at the Department of Health and Human Services work productively together. This report provides an update on potentially effective antibacterial drugs in the late-stage development pipeline, in the hope of encouraging such collaborative action.",

    "abstract_text": "Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology.7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible.To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.",

    "abstract_text": "The evolution of macrophages has made them primordial for both development and immunity. Their functions range from the shaping of body plans to the ingestion and elimination of apoptotic cells and pathogens. Cytokines are small soluble proteins that confer instructions and mediate communication among immune and non-immune cells. A portfolio of cytokines is central to the role of macrophages as sentries of the innate immune system that mediate the transition from innate to adaptive immunity. In concert with other mediators, cytokines bias the fate of macrophages into a spectrum of inflammation-promoting 'classically activated', to anti-inflammatory or 'alternatively activated' macrophages. Deregulated cytokine secretion is implicated in several disease states ranging from chronic inflammation to allergy. Macrophages release cytokines via a series of beautifully orchestrated pathways that are spatiotemporally regulated. At the molecular level, these exocytic cytokine secretion pathways are coordinated by multi-protein complexes that guide cytokines from their point of synthesis to their ports of exit into the extracellular milieu. These trafficking proteins, many of which were discovered in yeast and commemorated in the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, coordinate the organelle fusion steps that are responsible for cytokine release. This review discusses the functions of cytokines secreted by macrophages, and summarizes what is known about their release mechanisms. This information will be used to delve into how selected pathogens subvert cytokine release for their own survival.",

    "abstract_text": "Aspergillus species have emerged as an important cause of life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. This expanding population is composed of patients with prolonged neutropenia, advanced HIV infection, and inherited immunodeficiency and patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and/or lung transplantation. This document constitutes the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America for treatment of aspergillosis and replaces the practice guidelines for Aspergillus published in 2000 [1]. The objective of these guidelines is to summarize the current evidence for treatment of different forms of aspergillosis. The quality of evidence for treatment is scored according to a standard system used in other Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. This document reviews guidelines for management of the 3 major forms of aspergillosis: invasive aspergillosis, chronic (and saprophytic) forms of aspergillosis, and allergic forms of aspergillosis. Given the public health importance of invasive aspergillosis, emphasis is placed on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the different forms of invasive aspergillosis, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, sinus aspergillosis, disseminated aspergillosis, and several types of single-organ invasive aspergillosis. There are few randomized trials on the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. The largest randomized controlled trial demonstrates that voriconazole is superior to deoxycholate amphotericin B (D-AMB) as primary treatment for invasive aspergillosis. Voriconazole is recommended for the primary treatment of invasive aspergillosis in most patients (A-I). Although invasive pulmonary aspergillosis accounts for the preponderance of cases treated with voriconazole, voriconazole has been used in enough cases of extrapulmonary and disseminated infection to allow one to infer that voriconazole is effective in these cases. A randomized trial comparing 2 doses of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) showed similar efficacy in both arms, suggesting that liposomal therapy could be considered as alternative primary therapy in some patients (A-I). For salvage therapy, agents include lipid formulations of amphotericin (LFAB; A-II), posaconazole (B-II), itraconazole (B-II), caspofungin (B-II), or micafungin (B-II). Salvage therapy for invasive aspergillosis poses important challenges with significant gaps in knowledge. In patients whose aspergillosis is refractory to voriconazole, a paucity of data exist to guide management. Therapeutic options include a change of class using an amphotericin B (AMB) formulation or an echinocandin, such as caspofungin (B-II); further use of azoles should take into account host factors and pharmacokinetic considerations. Refractory infection may respond to a change to another drug class (B-II) or to a combination of agents (B-II). The role of combination therapy in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis as primary or salvage therapy is uncertain and warrants a prospective, controlled clinical trial. Assessment of patients with refractory aspergillosis may be difficult. In evaluating such patients, the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis should be established if it was previously uncertain and should be confirmed if it was previously known. The drug dosage should be considered. Management options include a change to intravenous (IV) therapy, therapeutic monitoring of drug levels, change of drug class, and/or combination therapy. Antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole can be recommended in the subgroup of HSCT recipients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) who are at high risk for invasive aspergillosis and in neutropenic patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who are at high risk for invasive aspergillosis (A-I). Management of breakthrough invasive aspergillosis in the context of mould-active azole prophylaxis is not defined by clinical trial data. The approach to such patients should be individualized on the basis of clinical criteria, including host immunosuppression, underlying disease, and site of infection, as well as consideration of antifungal dosing, therapeutic monitoring of drug levels, a switch to IV therapy, and/or a switch to another drug class (B-III). Certain conditions of invasive aspergillosis warrant consideration for surgical resection of the infected focus. These include but are not limited to pulmonary lesions contiguous with the heart or great vessels, invasion of the chest wall, osteomyelitis, pericardial infection, and endocarditis (B-III). Restoration of impaired host defenses is critical for improved outcome of invasive aspergillosis (A-III). Recovery from neutropenia in a persistently neutropenic host or reduction of corticosteroids in a patient receiving high-dose glucocorticosteroids is paramount for improved outcome in invasive aspergillosis. A special consideration is made concerning recommendations for therapy of aspergillosis in uncommon sites, such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis. There are very limited data on these infections, and most involve D-AMB as primary therapy simply because of its long-standing availability. Based on the strength of the randomized study, the panel recommends voriconazole for primary treatment of these very uncommon manifestations of invasive aspergillosis (B-III). Management of the chronic or saprophytic forms of aspergillosis varies depending on the condition. Single pulmonary aspergillomas may be best managed by surgical resection (B-III), whereas chronic cavitary and chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis require long-term medical therapy (B-III). The management of allergic forms of aspergillosis involves a combination of medical and anti-inflammatory therapy. For example, management of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) involves the administration of itraconazole and corticosteroids (A-I). \u00a9 2008 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

    "abstract_text": "Abstract Seasonal variations in temperature, rainfall and resource availability are ubiquitous and can exert strong pressures on population dynamics. Infectious diseases provide some of the best\u2010studied examples of the role of seasonality in shaping population fluctuations. In this paper, we review examples from human and wildlife disease systems to illustrate the challenges inherent in understanding the mechanisms and impacts of seasonal environmental drivers. Empirical evidence points to several biologically distinct mechanisms by which seasonality can impact host\u2013pathogen interactions, including seasonal changes in host social behaviour and contact rates, variation in encounters with infective stages in the environment, annual pulses of host births and deaths and changes in host immune defences. Mathematical models and field observations show that the strength and mechanisms of seasonality can alter the spread and persistence of infectious diseases, and that population\u2010level responses can range from simple annual cycles to more complex multiyear fluctuations. From an applied perspective, understanding the timing and causes of seasonality offers important insights into how parasite\u2013host systems operate, how and when parasite control measures should be applied, and how disease risks will respond to anthropogenic climate change and altered patterns of seasonality. Finally, by focusing on well\u2010studied examples of infectious diseases, we hope to highlight general insights that are relevant to other ecological interactions.",

    "abstract_text": "Cryptococcosis is a global invasive mycosis associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These guidelines for its management have been built on the previous Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines from 2000 and include new sections. There is a discussion of the management of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in 3 risk groups: (1) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, (2) organ transplant recipients, and (3) non-HIV-infected and nontransplant hosts. There are specific recommendations for other unique risk populations, such as children, pregnant women, persons in resource-limited environments, and those with Cryptococcus gattii infection. Recommendations for management also include other sites of infection, including strategies for pulmonary cryptococcosis. Emphasis has been placed on potential complications in management of cryptococcal infection, including increased intracranial pressure, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), drug resistance, and cryptococcomas. Three key management principles have been articulated: (1) induction therapy for meningoencephalitis using fungicidal regimens, such as a polyene and flucytosine, followed by suppressive regimens using fluconazole; (2) importance of early recognition and treatment of increased intracranial pressure and/or IRIS; and (3) the use of lipid formulations of amphotericin B regimens in patients with renal impairment. Cryptococcosis remains a challenging management issue, with little new drug development or recent definitive studies. However, if the diagnosis is made early, if clinicians adhere to the basic principles of these guidelines, and if the underlying disease is controlled, then cryptococcosis can be managed successfully in the vast majority of patients.",

It is intended as a guide for the use of antimicrobial agents in managing patients with cancer who experience chemotherapy-induced fever and neutropenia. Recent advances in antimicrobial drug development and technology, clinical trial results, and extensive clinical experience have informed the approaches and recommendations herein. Because the previous iteration of this guideline in 2002, we have a developed a clearer definition of which populations of patients with cancer may benefit most from antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral prophylaxis. Furthermore, categorizing neutropenic patients as being at high risk or low risk for infection according to presenting signs and symptoms, underlying cancer, type of therapy, and medical comorbidities has become essential to the treatment algorithm. Risk stratification is a recommended starting point for managing patients with fever and neutropenia. In addition, earlier detection of invasive fungal infections has led to debate regarding optimal use of empirical or preemptive antifungal therapy, although algorithms are still evolving. What has not changed is the indication for immediate empirical antibiotic therapy. It remains true that all patients who present with fever and neutropenia should be treated swiftly and broadly with antibiotics to treat both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. Finally, we note that all Panel members are from institutions in the United States or Canada; thus, these guidelines were developed in the context of North American practices. Some recommendations may not be as applicable outside of North America, in areas where differences in available antibiotics, in the predominant pathogens, and/or in health care-associated economic conditions exist. Regardless of venue, clinical vigilance and immediate treatment are the universal keys to managing neutropenic patients with fever and/or infection.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract \"Emerging\" infectious diseases can be defined as infections that have newly appeared in a population or have existed but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range. Among recent examples are HIV/AIDS, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Lyme disease, and hemolytic uremic syndrome (a foodborne infection caused by certain strains of Escherichia coli). Specific factors precipitating disease emergence can be identified in virtually all cases. These include ecological, environmental, or demographic factors that place people at increased contact with a previously unfamiliar microbe or its natural host or promote dissemination. These factors are increasing in prevalence; this increase, together with the ongoing evolution of viral and microbial variants and selection for drug resistance, suggests that infections will continue to emerge and probably increase and emphasizes the urgent need for effective surveillance and control. Dr. David Satcher's article and this overview inaugurate Perspectives, a regular section in this journal intended to present and develop unifying concepts and strategies for considering emerging infections and their underlying factors. The editors welcome, as contributions to the Perspectives section, overviews, syntheses, and case studies that shed light on how and why infections emerge, and how they may be anticipated and prevented.",

The result has been the emergence of a crisis discipline, reminiscent of the early phases of conservation biology. Latitudinal, altitudinal, seasonal, and interannual associations between climate and disease along with historical and experimental evidence suggest that climate, along with many other factors, can affect infectious diseases in a nonlinear fashion. However, although the globe is significantly warmer than it was a century ago, there is little evidence that climate change has already favored infectious diseases. While initial projections suggested dramatic future increases in the geographic range of infectious diseases, recent models predict range shifts in disease distributions, with little net increase in area.

The association of Vibrio cholerae with plankton, notably copepods, provides further evidence for the environmental origin of cholera, as well as an explanation for the sporadic and erratic occurrence of cholera epidemics. On a global scale, cholera epidemics can now be related to climate and climatic events, such as El Ni\u00f1o, as well as the global distribution of the plankton host.

    "abstract_text": "Among the realistic ingredients to be considered in the computational modeling of infectious diseases, human mobility represents a crucial challenge both on the theoretical side and in view of the limited availability of empirical data. In order to study the interplay between small-scale commuting flows and long-range airline traffic in shaping the spatio-temporal pattern of a global epidemic we i) analyze mobility data from 29 countries around the world and find a gravity model able to provide a global description of commuting patterns up to 300 kms; ii) integrate in a worldwide structured metapopulation epidemic model a time-scale separation technique for evaluating the force of infection due to multiscale mobility processes in the disease dynamics. Commuting flows are found, on average, to be one order of magnitude larger than airline flows. However, their introduction into the worldwide model shows that the large scale pattern of the simulated epidemic exhibits only small variations with respect to the baseline case where only airline traffic is considered. The presence of short range mobility increases however the synchronization of subpopulations in close proximity and affects the epidemic behavior at the periphery of the airline transportation infrastructure. The present approach outlines the possibility for the definition of layered computational approaches where different modeling assumptions and granularities can be used consistently in a unifying multi-scale framework.",

Because these measures depend on the recognition of specific disease symptoms, we investigate the relative timing of infectiousness and the appearance of symptoms by using a mathematical model. We show that the success of these control measures is determined as much by the proportion of transmission occurring prior to the onset of overt clinical symptoms (or via asymptomatic infection) as the inherent transmissibility of the etiological agent (measured by the reproductive number R 0 ). From published studies, we estimate these quantities for two moderately transmissible viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and HIV, and for two highly transmissible viruses, smallpox and pandemic influenza. We conclude that severe acute respiratory syndrome and smallpox are easier to control using these simple public health measures. Direct estimation of the proportion of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections is achievable by contact tracing and should be a priority during an outbreak of a novel infectious agent.",

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY The traditional identification of bacteria on the basis of phenotypic characteristics is generally not as accurate as identification based on genotypic methods. Comparison of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence has emerged as a preferred genetic technique. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis can better identify poorly described, rarely isolated, or phenotypically aberrant strains, can be routinely used for identification of mycobacteria, and can lead to the recognition of novel pathogens and noncultured bacteria. Problems remain in that the sequences in some databases are not accurate, there is no consensus quantitative definition of genus or species based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data, the proliferation of species names based on minimal genetic and phenotypic differences raises communication difficulties, and microheterogeneity in 16S rRNA gene sequence within a species is common. Despite its accuracy, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis lacks widespread use beyond the large and reference laboratories because of technical and cost considerations. Thus, a future challenge is to translate information from 16S rRNA gene sequencing into convenient biochemical testing schemes, making the accuracy of the genotypic identification available to the smaller and routine clinical microbiology laboratories.",

Emerging evidence also indicates that cell death contributes to immune defense against infectious diseases. Pyroptosis is a form of inflammatory programmed cell death pathway activated by human and mouse caspase\u20101, human caspase\u20104 and caspase\u20105, or mouse caspase\u201011. These inflammatory caspases are used by the host to control bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoan pathogens. Pyroptosis requires cleavage and activation of the pore\u2010forming effector protein gasdermin D by inflammatory caspases. Physical rupture of the cell causes release of the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines IL \u20101\u03b2 and IL \u201018, alarmins and endogenous danger\u2010associated molecular patterns, signifying the inflammatory potential of pyroptosis. Here, we describe the central role of inflammatory caspases and pyroptosis in mediating immunity to infection and clearance of pathogens.",

While behavioural responses to the spread of a disease have often been reported anecdotally, there has been relatively little systematic investigation into how behavioural changes can affect disease dynamics. Mathematical models for the spread of infectious diseases are an important tool for investigating and quantifying such effects, not least because the spread of a disease among humans is not amenable to direct experimental study. Here, we review recent efforts to incorporate human behaviour into disease models, and propose that such models can be broadly classified according to the type and source of information which individuals are assumed to base their behaviour on, and according to the assumed effects of such behaviour. We highlight recent advances as well as gaps in our understanding of the interplay between infectious disease dynamics and human behaviour, and suggest what kind of data taking efforts would be helpful in filling these gaps.",

Migratory demands can also reduce immune function, with consequences for host susceptibility and mortality.

However, this clear dichotomy in animal models is not as obvious in humans, and the separating line between M1-like and M2-like macrophages is rather represented by a continuum, where boundaries are still unclear. Indeed, human infectious diseases, are characterized by either a back and forth or often a mixed profile between the pro-inflammatory microenvironment (dominated by interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23 and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-\u03b1 cytokines) and tissue injury driven by classically activated macrophages (M1-like) and wound healing driven by alternatively activated macrophages (M2-like) in an anti-inflammatory environment (dominated by IL-10, Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, chemokine ligand (CCL)1, CCL2, CCL17, CCL18, and CCL22). This review brews the complexity of the situation during infectious diseases by stressing on this continuum between M1-like and M2-like extremes. We first discuss the basic biology of macrophage polarization, function, and role in the inflammatory process and its resolution. Secondly, we discuss the relevance of the macrophage polarization continuum during infectious and neglected diseases, and the possibility to interfere with such activation states as a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of such diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "Foot infections are a common and serious problem in persons with diabetes. Diabetic foot infections (DFIs) typically begin in a wound, most often a neuropathic ulceration. While all wounds are colonized with microorganisms, the presence of infection is defined by \u22652 classic findings of inflammation or purulence. Infections are then classified into mild (superficial and limited in size and depth), moderate (deeper or more extensive), or severe (accompanied by systemic signs or metabolic perturbations). This classification system, along with a vascular assessment, helps determine which patients should be hospitalized, which may require special imaging procedures or surgical interventions, and which will require amputation. Most DFIs are polymicrobial, with aerobic gram-positive cocci (GPC), and especially staphylococci, the most common causative organisms. Aerobic gram-negative bacilli are frequently copathogens in infections that are chronic or follow antibiotic treatment, and obligate anaerobes may be copathogens in ischemic or necrotic wounds. Wounds without evidence of soft tissue or bone infection do not require antibiotic therapy. For infected wounds, obtain a post-debridement specimen (preferably of tissue) for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Empiric antibiotic therapy can be narrowly targeted at GPC in many acutely infected patients, but those at risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms or with chronic, previously treated, or severe infections usually require broader spectrum regimens. Imaging is helpful in most DFIs; plain radiographs may be sufficient, but magnetic resonance imaging is far more sensitive and specific. Osteomyelitis occurs in many diabetic patients with a foot wound and can be difficult to diagnose (optimally defined by bone culture and histology) and treat (often requiring surgical debridement or resection, and/or prolonged antibiotic therapy). Most DFIs require some surgical intervention, ranging from minor (debridement) to major (resection, amputation). Wounds must also be properly dressed and off-loaded of pressure, and patients need regular follow-up. An ischemic foot may require revascularization, and some nonresponding patients may benefit from selected adjunctive measures. Employing multidisciplinary foot teams improves outcomes. Clinicians and healthcare organizations should attempt to monitor, and thereby improve, their outcomes and processes in caring for DFIs.",

    "abstract_text": "The ongoing explosion of antibiotic-resistant infections continues to plague global and US health care. Meanwhile, an equally alarming decline has occurred in the research and development of new antibiotics to deal with the threat. In response to this microbial \"perfect storm,\" in 2001, the federal Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance released the \"Action Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance; Part 1: Domestic\" to strengthen the response in the United States. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) followed in 2004 with its own report, \"Bad Bugs, No Drugs: As Antibiotic Discovery Stagnates, A Public Health Crisis Brews,\" which proposed incentives to reinvigorate pharmaceutical investment in antibiotic research and development. The IDSA's subsequent lobbying efforts led to the introduction of promising legislation in the 109 th US Congress (January 2005-December 2006). Unfortunately, the legislation was not enacted. During the 110 th Congress, the IDSA has continued to work with congressional leaders on promising legislation to address antibiotic-resistant infection. Nevertheless, despite intensive public relations and lobbying efforts, it remains unclear whether sufficiently robust legislation will be enacted. In the meantime, microbes continue to become more resistant, the antibiotic pipeline continues to diminish, and the majority of the public remains unaware of this critical situation. The result of insufficient federal funding; insufficient surveillance, prevention, and control; insufficient research and development activities; misguided regulation of antibiotics in agriculture and, in particular, for food animals; and insufficient overall coordination of US (and international) efforts could mean a literal return to the preantibiotic era for many types of infections. If we are to address the antimicrobial resistance crisis, a concerted, grassroots effort led by the medical community will be required.",

Taking an evolutionary approach, Ewald views disease-producing bacteria and viruses as parasites and explains the history of disease as a host-parasite relationship, one which can evolve in many different effects on the host population. He explains why the agents of cholera, malaria, and AIDS are so dangerous and why treatment of virtually all diseases would be improved by applications of evolutionary principles. This merging of evolutionary biology with health sciences offers a new dimension to policy-making in the health sciences by identifying interventions that will force infectious organisms to evolve toward a benign state, to subdue the plagues of the past and help us to avert the plagues of the future.

    "abstract_text": "OBJECTIVE\u2014In vitro evidence shows that immune function is compromised in people with diabetes. Although certain rare infections are more common and infection-related mortality is higher, the risk of acquiring an infectious disease for diabetic patients has never been quantified. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\u2014A retrospective cohort study using administrative data compared all people with diabetes in Ontario, Canada, on 1 April 1999 to matched nondiabetic people (n = 513,749 in each group). The risk ratios of having an infectious disease and of death attributable to infectious disease between those with and without diabetes were calculated. Secondary analysis individually examined common infectious diseases. The study was repeated using a second pair of cohorts defined in 1996 to confirm stability of the estimates. RESULTS\u2014Nearly half of all people with diabetes had at least one hospitalization or physician claim for an infectious disease in each cohort year. The risk ratio for diabetic versus nondiabetic people was 1.21 (99% CI 1.20\u20131.22) in both cohort years. The risk ratio for infectious disease-related hospitalization was up to 2.17 (99% CI 2.10\u20132.23). The risk ratio for death attributable to infection was up to 1.92 (1.79\u20132.05). Many individual infections were more common in people with diabetes, especially serious bacterial infections. CONCLUSIONS\u2014Diabetes confers an increased risk of developing and dying from an infectious disease, corroborating both in vitro evidence and commonly held clinical belief. In addition to microvascular and macrovascular sequelae, clinicians should consider infection a complication of diabetes.",

In this review, we discuss the impact that these practical innovations have had on the study of rickettsiae. Prior to 1986, only eight rickettsioses were clinically recognized; however, in the last 10 years, an additional six have been discovered. We describe the different steps that resulted in the description of each new rickettsiosis and discuss the influence of factors as diverse as physicians' curiosity and the adoption of molecular biology-based identification in helping to recognize these new infections. We also assess the pathogenic potential of rickettsial strains that to date have been associated only with arthropods, and we discuss diseases of unknown etiology that may be rickettsioses.",

    "abstract_text": "The extent to which the biodiversity and community composition of ecosystems affect their functions is an issue that grows ever more compelling as human impacts on ecosystems increase. We present evidence that supports a novel function of vertebrate biodiversity, the buffering of human risk of exposure to Lyme-disease-bearing ticks. We tested the Dilution Effect model, which predicts that high species diversity in the community of tick hosts reduces vector infection prevalence by diluting the effects of the most competent disease reservoir, the ubiquitous white-footed mouse ( Peromyscus leucopus ). As habitats are degraded by fragmentation or other anthropogenic forces, some members of the host community disappear. Thus, species-poor communities tend to have mice, but few other hosts, whereas species-rich communities have mice, plus many other potential hosts. We demonstrate that the most common nonmouse hosts are relatively poor reservoirs for the Lyme spirochete and should reduce the prevalence of the disease by feeding, but rarely infecting, ticks. By accounting for nearly every host species' contribution to the number of larval ticks fed and infected, we show that as new host species are added to a depauperate community, the nymphal infection prevalence, a key risk factor, declines. We identify important \u201cdilution hosts\u201d (e.g., squirrels), characterized by high tick burdens, low reservoir competence, and high population density, as well as \u201crescue hosts\u201d (e.g., shrews), which are capable of maintaining high disease risk when mouse density is low. Our study suggests that the preservation of vertebrate biodiversity and community composition can reduce the incidence of Lyme disease.",

Clostridium difficile remains the most important cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and has become the most commonly identified cause of healthcare-associated infection in adults in the United States. Moreover, C. difficile has established itself as an important community pathogen. Although the prevalence of the epidemic and virulent ribotype 027 strain has declined markedly along with overall CDI rates in parts of Europe, it remains one of the most commonly identified strains in the United States where it causes a sizable minority of CDIs, especially healthcare-associated CDIs.

The key threshold result of epidemic theory associates the outbreaks of epidemics and the persistence of endemic levels with basic reproduction numbers greater than one. Because the magnitude of R 0 allows one to determine the amount of effort which is necessary either to prevent an epidemic or to eliminate an infection from a population, it is crucial to estimate Ro for a given disease in a particular population.

Some parameter values from literature data are used to illustrate the results. Finally, references for other ways to calculate \u211b0 are given.

    "abstract_text": "The complement system consists of both plasma and membrane proteins. The former influence the inflammatory response, immune modulation, and host defense. The latter are complement receptors, which mediate the cellular effects of complement activation, and regulatory proteins, which protect host cells from complement-mediated injury. Complement activation occurs via either the classical or the alternative pathway, which converge at the level of C3 and share a sequence of terminal components. Four aspects of the complement cascade are critical to its function and regulation: (i) activation of the classical pathway, (ii) activation of the alternative pathway, (iii) C3 convertase formation and C3 deposition, and (iv) membrane attack complex assembly and insertion. In general, mechanisms evolved by pathogenic microbes to resist the effects of complement are targeted to these four steps. Because individual complement proteins subserve unique functional activities and are activated in a sequential manner, complement deficiency states are associated with predictable defects in complement-dependent functions. These deficiency states can be grouped by which of the above four mechanisms they disrupt. They are distinguished by unique epidemiologic, clinical, and microbiologic features and are most prevalent in patients with certain rheumatologic and infectious diseases. Ethnic background and the incidence of infection are important cofactors determining this prevalence. Although complement undoubtedly plays a role in host defense against many microbial pathogens, it appears most important in protection against encapsulated bacteria, especially Neisseria meningitidis but also Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and, to a lesser extent, Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The availability of effective polysaccharide vaccines and antibiotics provides an immunologic and chemotherapeutic rationale for preventing and treating infection in patients with these deficiencies.",

    "abstract_text": "\u25aa Abstract Twin and adoptee studies have indicated that host genetic factors are major determinants of susceptibility to infectious diseases in humans. Twin studies have also found high heritabilities for many humoral and cellular immune responses to pathogen antigens, with most of the genetic component mapping outside of the major histocompatibility complex. Candidate gene studies have implicated several immunogenetic polymorphisms in human infectious diseases. HLA variation has been associated with susceptibility or resistance to malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, AIDS, and hepatitis virus persistence. Variation in the tumor necrosis factor gene promoter has also been associated with several infectious diseases. Chemokine receptor polymorphism affects both susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and the rate of progression to AIDS. Inactivating mutations of the \u03b3-interferon receptor lead to increased susceptibility to atypical mycobacteria and disseminated BCG infection in homozygous children. The active form of vitamin D has immunomodulatory effects, and allelic variants of the vitamin D receptor appear to be associated with differential susceptibility to several infectious diseases. NRAMP1, a macrophage gene identified by positional cloning of its murine homologue, has been implicated in susceptibility to tuberculosis in Africans. Whole genome linkage analysis of multi-case families is now being used to map and identify new loci affecting susceptibility to infectious diseases. It is likely that susceptibility to most microorganisms is determined by a large number of polymorphic genes, and identification of these should provide insights into protective and pathogenic mechanisms in infectious diseases.",

Conversely, Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13 and stimulate type 2 immunity, which is characterized by high antibody titers. Type 1 and type 2 immunity are not strictly synonymous with cell-mediated and humoral immunity, because Th1 cells also stimulate moderate levels of antibody production, whereas Th2 cells actively suppress phagocytosis. For most infections, save those caused by large eukaryotic pathogens, type 1 immunity is protective, whereas type 2 responses assist with the resolution of cell-mediated inflammation. Severe systemic stress, immunosuppression, or overwhelming microbial inoculation causes the immune system to mount a type 2 response to an infection normally controlled by type 1 immunity. In such cases, administration of antimicrobial chemotherapy and exogenous cytokines restores systemic balance, which allows successful immune responses to clear the infection.",

Climatologists have identified upward trends in global temperatures and now estimate an unprecedented rise of 2.0 degrees C by the year 2100. Of major concern is that these changes can affect the introduction and dissemination of many serious infectious diseases. The incidence of mosquito-borne diseases, including malaria, dengue, and viral encephalitides, are among those diseases most sensitive to climate. Climate change would directly affect disease transmission by shifting the vector's geographic range and increasing reproductive and biting rates and by shortening the pathogen incubation period. Climate-related increases in sea surface temperature and sea level can lead to higher incidence of water-borne infectious and toxin-related illnesses, such as cholera and shellfish poisoning. Human migration and damage to health infrastructures from the projected increase in climate variability could indirectly contribute to disease transmission. Human susceptibility to infections might be further compounded by malnutrition due to climate stress on agriculture and potential alterations in the human immune system caused by increased flux of ultraviolet radiation. Analyzing the role of climate in the emergence of human infectious diseases will require interdisciplinary cooperation among physicians, climatologists, biologists, and social scientists. Increased disease surveillance, integrated modeling, and use of geographically based data systems will afford more anticipatory measures by the medical community. Understanding the linkages between climatological and ecological change as determinants of disease emergence and redistribution will ultimately help optimize preventive strategies.",

Indeed, the original hypothesis for the extreme variability observed at HLA loci (H-2 in mice) was the major selective pressure from infectious diseases. Now that both the human genome and the molecular basis of innate and acquired immunity are understood in greater detail, do the classical HLA loci still stand out as major genes that determine susceptibility to infectious disease? This review looks afresh at the evidence supporting a role for classical HLA loci in susceptibility to infectious disease, examines the limitations of data reported to date, and discusses current advances in methodology and technology that will potentially lead to greater understanding of their role in infectious diseases in the future.",

    "abstract_text": "The continuing unresolved debate over the interaction of iron and infection indicates a need for quantitative review of clinical morbidity outcomes. Iron deficiency is associated with reversible abnormalities of immune function, but it is difficult to demonstrate the severity and relevance of these in observational studies. Iron treatment has been associated with acute exacerbations of infection, in particular, malaria. Oral iron has been associated with increased rates of clinical malaria (5 of 9 studies) and increased morbidity from other infectious disease (4 of 8 studies). In most instances, therapeutic doses of oral iron were used. No studies in malarial regions showed benefits. Knowledge of local prevalence of causes of anemia including iron deficiency, seasonal malarial endemicity, protective hemoglobinopathies and age-specific immunity is essential in planning interventions. A balance must be struck in dose of oral iron and the timing of intervention with respect to age and malaria transmission. Antimalarial intervention is important. No studies of oral iron supplementation clearly show deleterious effects in nonmalarious areas. Milk fortification reduced morbidity due to respiratory disease in two very early studies in nonmalarious regions, but this was not confirmed in three later fortification studies, and better morbidity rates could be achieved by breast-feeding alone. One study in a nonmalarious area of Indonesia showed reduced infectious outcome after oral iron supplementation of anemic schoolchildren. No systematic studies report oral iron supplementation and infectious morbidity in breast-fed infants in nonmalarious regions.",

Much of the interest has been stimulated by the growing problems of antibiotic resistance among pathogens, emergence and/or reemergence of infectious diseases worldwide, the potential of bioterrorism, and the debate concerning climate change. Cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae , lends itself to analyses of the role of climate in infectious disease, coupled to population dynamics of pathogenic microorganisms, for several reasons. First, the disease has a historical context linking it to specific seasons and biogeographical zones. In addition, the population dynamics of V. cholerae in the environment are strongly controlled by environmental factors, such as water temperature, salinity, and the presence of copepods, which are, in turn, controlled by larger-scale climate variability. In this review, the association between plankton and V. cholerae that has been documented over the last 20 years is discussed in support of the hypothesis that cholera shares properties of a vector-borne disease. In addition, a model for environmental transmission of cholera to humans in the context of climate variability is presented. The cholera model provides a template for future research on climate-sensitive diseases, allowing definition of critical parameters and offering a means of developing more sophisticated methods for prediction of disease outbreaks.",

This paper examines the causes and consequences of seasonality, and in so doing derives several new results concerning vaccination strategy and the interpretation of disease outbreak data. It begins with a brief review of published scientific studies in support of different causes of seasonality in infectious diseases of humans, identifying four principal mechanisms and their association with different routes of transmission. It then describes the consequences of seasonality for R 0 , disease outbreaks, endemic dynamics and persistence. Finally, a mathematical analysis of routine and pulse vaccination programmes for seasonal infections is presented. The synthesis of seasonal infectious disease epidemiology attempted by this paper highlights the need for further empirical and theoretical work.",

Animals typically exhibit considerable genetic variation for resistance (the ability to limit parasite burden). However, little is known about whether animals can evolve tolerance (the ability to limit the damage caused by a given parasite burden). Using rodent malaria in laboratory mice as a model system and the statistical framework developed by plant-pathogen biologists, we demonstrated genetic variation for tolerance, as measured by the extent to which anemia and weight loss increased with increasing parasite burden. Moreover, resistance and tolerance were negatively genetically correlated. These results mean that animals, like plants, can evolve two conceptually different types of defense, a finding that has important implications for the understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of infectious diseases.",

At 94% coverage, we collected 762,868 CPIs at a maximal distance of 3 m among 788 individuals. The data revealed a high-density network with typical small-world properties and a relatively homogeneous distribution of both interaction time and interaction partners among subjects.

Trends in age-specific infectious disease mortality were examined by using age-specific death rates for 9 common infectious causes of death.Persons who died in the United States between 1900 and 1996.Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates.Infectious disease mortality declined during the first 8 decades of the 20th century from 797 deaths per 100000 in 1900 to 36 deaths per 100000 in 1980. From 1981 to 1995, the mortality rate increased to a peak of 63 deaths per 100000 in 1995 and declined to 59 deaths per 100000 in 1996. The decline was interrupted by a sharp spike in mortality caused by the 1918 influenza epidemic. From 1938 to 1952, the decline was particularly rapid, with mortality decreasing 8.2% per year. Pneumonia and influenza were responsible for the largest number of infectious disease deaths throughout the century. Tuberculosis caused almost as many deaths as pneumonia and influenza early in the century, but tuberculosis mortality dropped off sharply after 1945. Infectious disease mortality increased in the 1980s and early 1990s in persons aged 25 years and older and was mainly due to the emergence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 25- to 64-year-olds and, to a lesser degree, to increases in pneumonia and influenza deaths among persons aged 65 years and older. There was considerable year-to-year variability in infectious disease mortality, especially for the youngest and oldest age groups.Although most of the 20th century has been marked by declining infectious disease mortality, substantial year-to-year variation as well as recent increases emphasize the dynamic nature of infectious diseases and the need for preparedness to address them.",

The group established a systems model approach and priority lists of infectious diseases affected by ecologic degradation.

Humans' vulnerability to the potential health impacts by climate change is evident in literature. As an active agent, human beings may control the related health effects that may be effectively controlled through adopting proactive measures, including better understanding of the climate change patterns and of the compound disease-specific health effects, and effective allocation of technologies and resources to promote healthy lifestyles and public awareness. The following adaptation measures are recommended: 1) to go beyond empirical observations of the association between climate change and infectious diseases and develop more scientific explanations, 2) to improve the prediction of spatial-temporal process of climate change and the associated shifts in infectious diseases at various spatial and temporal scales, and 3) to establish locally effective early warning systems for the health effects of predicated climate change.",

We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an influenza outbreak.

In addition, because of an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.",

Zinc has also proven to decrease the duration of diarrhea by 15% (95% CI: 5-24%). Maternal zinc supplementation may lead to a decrease in infant infections. Studies assessing the role of zinc supplementation among persons with HIV, tuberculosis, and the common cold have not been conclusive.

Infectious diseases are common in the ocean, and here we tabulate 67 examples that can reduce commercial species' growth and survivorship or decrease seafood quality. These impacts seem most problematic in the stressful and crowded conditions of aquaculture, which increasingly dominates seafood production as wild fishery production plateaus. For instance, marine diseases of farmed oysters, shrimp, abalone, and various fishes, particularly Atlantic salmon, cost billions of dollars each year. In comparison, it is often difficult to accurately estimate disease impacts on wild populations, especially those of pelagic and subtidal species. Farmed species often receive infectious diseases from wild species and can, in turn, export infectious agents to wild species. However, the impact of disease export on wild fisheries is controversial because there are few quantitative data demonstrating that wild species near farms suffer more from infectious diseases than those in other areas. The movement of exotic infectious agents to new areas continues to be the greatest concern.",

We merged these records with ecological characteristics of the causal pathogens to examine global temporal trends in the total number of outbreaks, disease richness (number of unique diseases), disease diversity (richness and outbreak evenness) and per capita cases. Bacteria, viruses, zoonotic diseases (originating in animals) and those caused by pathogens transmitted by vector hosts were responsible for the majority of outbreaks in our dataset. After controlling for disease surveillance, communications, geography and host availability, we find the total number and diversity of outbreaks, and richness of causal diseases increased significantly since 1980 (p < 0.0001). When we incorporate Internet usage into the model to control for biased reporting of outbreaks (starting 1990), the overall number of outbreaks and disease richness still increase significantly with time (p < 0.0001), but per capita cases decrease significantly ( p = 0.005). Temporal trends in outbreaks differ based on the causal pathogen's taxonomy, host requirements and transmission mode. We discuss our preliminary findings in the context of global disease emergence and surveillance.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract Recent increases in the magnitude and rate of environmental change, including habitat loss, climate change and overexploitation, have been directly linked to the global loss of biodiversity. Wildlife extinction rates are estimated to be 100\u20131000 times greater than the historical norm, and up to 50% of higher taxonomic groups are critically endangered. While many types of environmental changes threaten the survival of species all over the planet, infectious disease has rarely been cited as the primary cause of global species extinctions. There is substantial evidence, however, that diseases can greatly impact local species populations by causing temporary or permanent declines in abundance. More importantly, pathogens can interact with other driving factors, such as habitat loss, climate change, overexploitation, invasive species and environmental pollution to contribute to local and global extinctions. Regrettably, our current lack of knowledge about the diversity and abundance of pathogens in natural systems has made it difficult to establish the relative importance of disease as a significant driver of species extinction, and the context when this is most likely to occur. Here, we review the role of infectious diseases in biological conservation. We summarize existing knowledge of disease\u2010induced extinction at global and local scales and review the ecological and evolutionary forces that may facilitate disease\u2010mediated extinction risk. We suggest that while disease alone may currently threaten few species, pathogens may be a significant threat to already\u2010endangered species, especially when disease interacts with other drivers. We identify control strategies that may help reduce the negative effects of disease on wildlife and discuss the most critical challenges and future directions for the study of infectious diseases in the conservation sciences.",

Also, during the initial stages of an outbreak of a new or reemerging pathogen, disease incidence tends to occur in spatial clusters, which makes containment possible if you can predict the subsequent spread of disease. Spatial models are being used with increasing frequency to help characterize these large-scale patterns and to evaluate the impact of interventions. Here, I review several recent studies on four diseases that show the benefits of different methodologies: measles (patch models), foot-and-mouth disease (distance-transmission models), pandemic influenza (multigroup models), and smallpox (network models). This review highlights the importance of the household in spatial studies of human diseases, such as smallpox and influenza. It also demonstrates the need to develop a simple model of household demographics, so that these large-scale models can be extended to the investigation of long\u2013time scale human pathogens, such as tuberculosis and HIV.",

The infectious agent responsible for TSEs is the prion, an abnormally folded and aggregated protein that propagates itself by imposing its conformation onto the cellular prion protein (PrPC) of the host. PrPC is necessary for prion replication and for prion-induced neurodegeneration, yet the proximal causes of neuronal injury and death are still poorly understood. Prion toxicity may arise from the interference with the normal function of PrPC, and therefore, understanding the physiological role of PrPC may help to clarify the mechanism underlying prion diseases. Here we discuss the evolution of the prion concept and how prion-like mechanisms may apply to other protein aggregation diseases. We describe the clinical and the pathological features of the prion diseases in human and animals, the events occurring during neuroinvasion, and the possible scenarios underlying brain damage. Finally, we discuss potential antiprion therapies and current developments in the realm of prion diagnostics.",

The review is split into four main sections, which examine: the types of network relevant to epidemiology; the multitude of ways these networks can be characterised; the statistical methods that can be applied to infer the epidemiological parameters on a realised network; and finally simulation and analytical methods to determine epidemic dynamics on a given network. Given the breadth of areas covered and the ever-expanding number of publications, a comprehensive review of all work is impossible. Instead, we provide a personalised overview into the areas of network epidemiology that have seen the greatest progress in recent years or have the greatest potential to provide novel insights. As such, considerable importance is placed on analytical approaches and statistical methods which are both rapidly expanding fields.

This guideline provides recommendations on the clinical and public health management of tuberculosis in children and adults in settings in which mycobacterial cultures, molecular and phenotypic drug susceptibility tests, and radiographic studies, among other diagnostic tools, are available on a routine basis. For all recommendations, literature reviews were performed, followed by discussion by an expert committee according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. Given the public health implications of prompt diagnosis and effective management of tuberculosis, empiric multidrug treatment is initiated in almost all situations in which active tuberculosis is suspected. Additional characteristics such as presence of comorbidities, severity of disease, and response to treatment influence management decisions. Specific recommendations on the use of case management strategies (including directly observed therapy), regimen and dosing selection in adults and children (daily vs intermittent), treatment of tuberculosis in the presence of HIV infection (duration of tuberculosis treatment and timing of initiation of antiretroviral therapy), as well as treatment of extrapulmonary disease (central nervous system, pericardial among other sites) are provided. The development of more potent and better-tolerated drug regimens, optimization of drug exposure for the component drugs, optimal management of tuberculosis in special populations, identification of accurate biomarkers of treatment effect, and the assessment of new strategies for implementing regimens in the field remain key priority areas for research.

    "abstract_text": "Dietary characteristics can modulate a bird's susceptibility to infectious challenges and subtle influences due to the level of nutrients or the types of ingredients may at times be of critical importance. This review considers seven mechanisms for nutritional modulation of resistance to infectious disease in poultry. 1) Nutrition may impact the development of the immune system, both in ovo and in the first weeks posthatch. Micronutrient deficiencies that affect developmental events, such as the seeding of lymphoid organs and clonal expansion of lymphocyte clones, can negatively impact the immune system later in life. 2) A substrate role of nutrients is necessary for the immune response so that responding cells can divide and synthesize effector molecules. The quantitative need for nutrients for supporting a normal immune system, as well as the proliferation of leukocytes and the production of antibodies during an infectious challenge, is very small relative to uses for growth or egg production. It is likely that the systemic acute phase response that accompanies most infectious challenges is a more significant consumer of nutrients than the immune system itself. 3) The low concentration of some nutrients (e.g., iron) in body fluids makes them the limiting substrates for the proliferation of invading pathogens and the supply of these nutrients is further limited during the immune response. 4) Some nutrients (e.g., fatty acids and vitamins A, D, and E) have direct regulatory actions on leukocytes by binding to intracellular receptors or by modifying the release of second messengers. 5) The diet may also have indirect regulatory effects that are mediated by the classical endocrine system. 6) Physical and chemical aspects of the diet can modify the populations of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract, the capacity of pathogens to attach to enterocytes, and the integrity of the intestinal epithelium.",

As access to technology has improved, social media has attained global penetrance. In contrast to traditional media, social media allow individuals to rapidly create and share content globally without editorial oversight. Users may self-select content streams, contributing to ideological isolation. As such, there are considerable public health concerns raised by anti-vaccination messaging on such platforms and the consequent potential for downstream vaccine hesitancy, including the compromise of public confidence in future vaccine development for novel pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 for the prevention of COVID-19.

    "abstract_text": "To quantify the effect of hand-hygiene interventions on rates of gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses and to identify interventions that provide the greatest efficacy, we searched 4 electronic databases for hand-hygiene trials published from January 1960 through May 2007 and conducted meta-analyses to generate pooled rate ratios across interventions (N=30 studies). Improvements in hand hygiene resulted in reductions in gastrointestinal illness of 31% (95% confidence intervals [CI]=19%, 42%) and reductions in respiratory illness of 21% (95% CI=5%, 34%). The most beneficial intervention was hand-hygiene education with use of nonantibacterial soap. Use of antibacterial soap showed little added benefit compared with use of nonantibacterial soap. Hand hygiene is clearly effective against gastrointestinal and, to a lesser extent, respiratory infections. Studies examining hygiene practices during respiratory illness and interventions targeting aerosol transmission are needed.",

    "abstract_text": "The dynamics of infectious diseases can be affected by genetic diversity within host populations, species diversity within host communities, and diversity among communities. In principle, diversity can either increase or decrease pathogen transmission and disease risk. Theoretical models and laboratory experiments have demonstrated that a dilution effect (decreased disease risk with increasing diversity) can occur under a wide range of conditions. Field studies of plants, aquatic invertebrates, amphibians, birds, and mammals demonstrate that the phenomenon indeed does occur in many natural systems. A dilution effect is expected when (a) hosts differ in quality for pathogens or vectors; (b) higher quality hosts tend to occur in species-poor communities, whereas lower quality hosts tend to occur in more diverse communities; and (c) lower quality hosts regulate abundance of high-quality hosts or of vectors, or reduce encounter rates between these hosts and pathogens or vectors. Although these conditions characterize many disease systems, our ability to predict when and where the dilution effect occurs remains poor. The life-history traits that cause some hosts to be widespread and resilient might be correlated with those that promote infection and transmission by some pathogens, supporting the notion that the dilution effect might be widespread among disease systems. Criticisms of the dilution effect have focused on whether species richness or species composition (both being metrics of biodiversity) drives disease risk. It is well established, however, that changes in species composition correlate with changes in species richness, and this correlation could explain why the dilution effect appears to be a general phenomenon.",

There is a need for frequently updated practice guidelines on their use, based on critical evaluation of rapidly emerging literature. The objective was to develop evidence-based rapid guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. Methods The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise. Process followed a rapid recommendation checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. Then a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and gray literature was conducted. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. Results The IDSA guideline panel agreed on 7 treatment recommendations and provided narrative summaries of other treatments undergoing evaluations. Conclusions The panel expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials, which would provide much-needed evidence on the efficacy and safety of various therapies for COVID-19, given that we could not make a determination whether the benefits outweigh harms for most treatments.",

    "abstract_text": "Invasive species, disease vectors, and pathogens affect biodiversity, ecosystem function and services, and human health. Climate change, land use, and transport vectors interact in complex ways to determine the spread of native and non-native invasive species, pathogens, and their effects on ecosystem dynamics. Early detection and in-depth understanding of invasive species and infectious diseases will require an integrated network of research platforms and information exchange to identify hotspots of invasion or disease emergence. Partnerships with state and federal agencies that monitor the spread and impacts of invasive species and pathogens will be critical in developing a national data and research network that can facilitate a full understanding of the resulting effects on ecosystems and society. Citizen science can also play a role; individuals can report new invasions, record phenological changes associated with invasions or disease outbreaks, and can participate in efforts such as the Breeding Bird Survey, which may reveal long-term biotic change following species invasions and disease spread. The ecological and societal impacts of invasive species and pathogens differ across gradients of climate and land use, and in the presence of global climate change may exacerbate both their propagation and impacts. Understanding the interactions of invasive species, disease vectors, and pathogens with other drivers of ecosystem change is critical to human health and economic well-being.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract: Infectious disease is listed among the top five causes of global species extinctions. However, the majority of available data supporting this contention is largely anecdotal. We used the IUCN Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species and literature indexed in the ISI Web of Science to assess the role of infectious disease in global species loss. Infectious disease was listed as a contributing factor in &lt;4% of species extinctions known to have occurred since 1500 (833 plants and animals) and as contributing to a species' status as critically endangered in &lt;8% of cases (2852 critically endangered plants and animals). Although infectious diseases appear to play a minor role in global species loss, our findings underscore two important limitations in the available evidence: uncertainty surrounding the threats to species survival and a temporal bias in the data. Several initiatives could help overcome these obstacles, including rigorous scientific tests to determine which infectious diseases present a significant threat at the species level, recognition of the limitations associated with the lack of baseline data for the role of infectious disease in species extinctions, combining data with theory to discern the circumstances under which infectious disease is most likely to serve as an agent of extinction, and improving surveillance programs for the detection of infectious disease. An evidence\u2010based understanding of the role of infectious disease in species extinction and endangerment will help prioritize conservation initiatives and protect global biodiversity.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved and tightly regulated cell death modality. It serves important roles in physiology by sculpting complex tissues during embryogenesis and by removing effete cells that have reached advanced age or whose genomes have been irreparably damaged. Apoptosis culminates in the rapid and decisive removal of cell corpses by efferocytosis, a term used to distinguish the engulfment of apoptotic cells from other phagocytic processes. Over the past decades, the molecular and cell biological events associated with efferocytosis have been rigorously studied, and many eat-me signals and receptors have been identified. The externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) is arguably the most emblematic eat-me signal that is in turn bound by a large number of serum proteins and opsonins that facilitate efferocytosis. Under physiological conditions, externalized PS functions as a dominant and evolutionarily conserved immunosuppressive signal that promotes tolerance and prevents local and systemic immune activation. Pathologically, the innate immunosuppressive effect of externalized PS has been hijacked by numerous viruses, microorganisms, and parasites to facilitate infection, and in many cases, establish infection latency. PS is also profoundly dysregulated in the tumor microenvironment and antagonizes the development of tumor immunity. In this review, we discuss the biology of PS with respect to its role as a global immunosuppressive signal and how PS is exploited to drive diverse pathological processes such as infection and cancer. Finally, we outline the rationale that agents targeting PS could have significant value in cancer and infectious disease therapeutics.",

Yet such inequalities have powerfully sculpted not only the distribution of infectious diseases, but also the course of disease in those affected. Outbreaks of Ebola, AIDS, and tuberculosis suggest that models of disease emergence need to be dynamic, systemic, and critical. Such models--which strive to incorporate change and complexity, and are global yet alive to local variation--are critical of facile claims of causality, particularly those that scant the pathogenic roles of social inequalities. Critical perspectives on emerging infections ask how large-scale social forces influence unequally positioned individuals in increasingly interconnected populations; a critical epistemology of emerging infectious diseases asks what features of disease emergence are obscured by dominant analytic frameworks. Research questions stemming from such a reexamination of disease emergence would demand close collaboration between basic scientists, clinicians, and the social scientists and epidemiologists who adopt such perspectives.",

The recognition of seasonal patterns in infectious disease occurrence dates back at least as far as the Hippocratic era, but mechanisms underlying seasonality of person-to-person transmitted diseases are not well understood. Improved understanding will enhance understanding of host-pathogen interactions and will improve the accuracy of public health surveillance and forecasting systems. Insight into seasonal disease patterns may be gained through the use of autocorrelation methods or construction of periodograms, while seasonal oscillation of infectious diseases can be easily simulated using simple transmission models. Models demonstrate that small seasonal changes in host or pathogen factors may be sufficient to create large seasonal surges in disease incidence, which may be important particularly in the context of global climate change. Seasonality represents a rich area for future research.",

    "title": "Infectious Diseases in Primates",
    "abstract_text": "Recent progress in the field of wildlife disease ecology demonstrates that infectious disease plays a crucial role in the lives of wild animals. Parasites and pathogens should be especially important for social animals in which high contact among individuals increases the potential for disease spread. As one of the best studied mammalian groups, primates offer a unique opportunity to examine how complex behaviours (including social organization) influence the risk of acquiring infectious diseases, and the defences used by animals to avoid infection. This book explores the correlates of disease risk in primates, including not only social and mating behaviour but also diet, habitat use, life history, geography and phylogeny. The authors examine how a core set of host and parasite traits influence patterns of parasitism at three levels of biological organization: among individuals, among populations, and across species. A major goal is to synthesize, for the first time, four disparate areas of research: primate behavioural ecology, parasite biology, wildlife epidemiology, and the behavioural and immune defences employed by animals to counter infectious disease. Throughout, the authors provide an overview of the remarkable diversity of infectious agents found in wild primate populations. Additional chapters consider how knowledge of infectious diseases in wild primates can inform efforts focused on primate conservation and human health. More generally, this book identifies infectious disease as an important frontier in our understanding of primate behaviour and ecology. It highlights future challenges for testing the links between host and parasite traits, including hypotheses for the effects of disease on primate social and mating systems.",

One year later, we reassessed these health care workers with the PSS-10, the 21-Item Depression and Anxiety Scale (DASS-21), and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R). We recruited high-risk health care workers who practised respiratory medicine and compared them with nonrespiratory medicine workers, who formed the low-risk health care worker control group.In 2003, high-risk health care workers had elevated stress levels (PSS-10 score = 17.0) that were not significantly different from levels in low-risk health care worker control subjects (PSS-10 score = 15.9). More high-risk health care workers reported fatigue, poor sleep, worry about health, and fear of social contact, despite their confidence in infection-control measures. By 2004, however, stress levels in the high-risk group were not only higher (PSS-10 score = 18.6) but also significantly higher than scores among low-risk health care worker control subjects (PSS-10 score = 14.8, P < 0.05). In 2004, the perceived stress levels in the high-risk group were associated with higher depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress scores (P < 0.001). Posttraumatic stress scores were a partial mediator of the relation between the high risk of exposure to SARS and higher perceived stress.Health care workers who were at high risk of contracting SARS appear not only to have chronic stress but also higher levels of depression and anxiety. Front-line staff could benefit from stress management as part of preparation for future outbreaks.",

A range of key examples are discussed in which animal movements have resulted in the introduction of pathogens to previously disease-free areas. Measures based on heightened surveillance are proposed that mitigate the risks of new pathogen introductions. Infectious diseases are transmitted between hosts by a variety of mechanisms, including direct, airborne and vector-borne transmission. Control of animal-to-animal transmission of disease agents is a key concept in infectious disease epidemiology; however, a more sensible approach might be to prevent the types of contact that lead to transmission in the first place. In humans, it is often difficult to prevent contacts, particularly with the ease of long-distance travel [1Wilson M.E. Travel and the emergence of infectious diseases.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1995; 1: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar]. However, in livestock and animals, movements can be the subject of legislation or strict controls and there is a real opportunity to reduce disease transmission. The importance of animal movements is, of course, well understood and international regulations [e.g. from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE; Box 1) ] exist to mitigate the risks involved [2Kellar J.A. The application of risk analysis to international trade in animal products.Rev. Sci. Tech. 1993; 12: 1023-1044PubMed Google Scholar]. In spite of these regulations, outbreaks occur regularly as a result of both legal and illegal animal movements.Useful web addressesInternational organizationsFood and Agriculture Organization: www.fao.orgWorld Health Organization: www.who.intWorld Organization for Animal Health: www.oie.intWorld Trade Organization: www.wto.intAfrican Union\u2013Inter African Bureau for Animal Research: www.au-ibar.orgOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development: www.oecd.orgInternational regulatory bodiesCouncil of Europe: www.coe.intEuropean Union: europa.eu.intConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora: www.cites.orgWorld Conservation Union: www.iucn.orgConvention on Biological Diversity: www.biodiv.orgInternational Air Transport Association: www.iata.orgNational regulatory and research bodiesUnited Kingdom Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: www.defra.gov.ukUnited Kingdom PET Passport Scheme: www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/quarantine/index.htmUnited Kingdom Foresight Project: www.foresight.gov.ukUnited States Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service: www.aphis.usda.govUnited States Centers for Disease Control: www.cdc.govUniversity of Edinburgh: www.ed.ac.uk Food and Agriculture Organization: www.fao.org World Health Organization: www.who.int World Organization for Animal Health: www.oie.int World Trade Organization: www.wto.int African Union\u2013Inter African Bureau for Animal Research: www.au-ibar.org Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development: www.oecd.org Council of Europe: www.coe.int European Union: europa.eu.int Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora: www.cites.org World Conservation Union: www.iucn.org Convention on Biological Diversity: www.biodiv.org International Air Transport Association: www.iata.org United Kingdom Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: www.defra.gov.uk United Kingdom PET Passport Scheme: www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/quarantine/index.htm United Kingdom Foresight Project: www.foresight.gov.uk United States Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service: www.aphis.usda.gov United States Centers for Disease Control: www.cdc.gov University of Edinburgh: www.ed.ac.uk In this review, we examine several issues that relate to the movement of domestic and wild animals and discuss the risks that these movements entail \u2013 at local, regional and global scales \u2013 with regard to the spread of disease. First, we present data on livestock movements at a global level, and highlight the scale of wildlife movements as a result of translocation by humans. Second, we provide key case studies of animal and animal-to-human (zoonotic) disease introductions in different parts of the world that have resulted in subsequent disease transmission and new outbreaks, with an emphasis on how introduction of the disease agents could have been prevented either through intervention or regulation. The trade in livestock, wildlife and animal products is enormous and complex, and occurs on many different scales. There are no overriding rules to control these movements and much of the trade is still based on bilateral agreements between countries. However, countries that are members of the World Trade Organization are bound by the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement (http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/sps_e/spsagr_e.htm), which concerns food safety and animal and plant health regulations. Countries are encouraged to base their sanitary and phytosanitary measures on existing international standards. The international standards relating to animal health and zoonoses were developed by the OIE and are stated in the aquatic and terrestrial animal health codes (http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/fcode/en_index.htm and http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/a_summry.htm, respectively). The aim of the codes is to assure the sanitary safety of the international trade in terrestrial animals and their products by detailing the health measures that should be used by the veterinary authorities. The important role of a good veterinary infrastructure to minimize the risks of disease spread has been emphasized [3Thiermann A. Emerging diseases and implications for global trade.Rev. Sci. Tech. 2004; 23: 701-707PubMed Google Scholar]. The relevant legislation for international wildlife trade [4Cooper M.E. Rosser A.M. International regulation of wildlife trade: relevant legislation and organisations.Rev. Sci. Tech. 2002; 21: 103-123PubMed Google Scholar] relates to three main areas: animal health, animal welfare and the international movement of endangered species. The animal health regulations relevant for livestock trade (see earlier) also apply to non-domesticated animals. However, additional regulations exist for wildlife to protect endangered species from overexploitation from trade, in the form of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Detailed guidelines have also been developed by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) to minimize disease risks associated with the intentional movement of wildlife for conservation or game management purposes: for example, the supplementation of populations, reintroduction of endangered species, removal of problem animals and the release of confiscated animals [4Cooper M.E. Rosser A.M. International regulation of wildlife trade: relevant legislation and organisations.Rev. Sci. Tech. 2002; 21: 103-123PubMed Google Scholar] (Table 1).Table 1Laws and other measures relevant to the trade and movement of domestic and wild animalsaAdapted from Ref.

Open table in a new tab The international trade in livestock is big business; for example, in 1996, China exported US$ 48 million, US$ 294 million and US$ 121 million worth of cattle, swine and poultry, respectively [5Carter, C.A. and Li, X. (1999) Economic reform and the changing pattern of China's agricultural trade (working paper no. 99-003). Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Davis. http://ideas.repec.org/p/cdl/aredav/1044.htmlGoogle Scholar]. In 1999, Sudan exported 1 616 363 sheep, 435 cattle, 40 501 goats and 159 483 camels, mainly to Egypt and the Middle East [6Aklilu, Y. et al. (2002) An audit of the livestock marketing status in Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan (vol. I). Community-Based Animal Health and Participatory Epidemiology Unit, Pan African Programme for the Control of Epizootics and Organization of African Unity/Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources. http://www.eldis.org/static/DOC11334.htmGoogle Scholar]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Global Livestock Production and Health Atlas (GLiPHA; http://www.fao.org/ag/aga/glipha/index.jsp) also provides data on live livestock imports for most countries of the world. For example, Australia exported 895 982 heads of cattle, 5 421 408 sheep, 2976 horses, and 5 asses in 2000 (Table 2), with large numbers of live sheep exported to the Middle East [7Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2000) Monthly Statistics of International Trade OECD (vols. 2000-1\u20132000-12). http://lysander.sourceoecd.org/Google Scholar].Table 2Examples of the volume of live imports of different livestock species from a range of countries in 2002aSource: FAO GLiPHA, available at http://www.fao.org/ag/aga/glipha.CountrySheepPigsChickensCattleBelgium52 261693 891136 25461 054UK0231 42735125966USA139 1625 741 27569522 505 279China30221163100211 432Brazil4951368137219 242Mozambique2876867841809Egypt68 195Data not available553792 492India0943204674Philippines44713662529117 146a Source: FAO GLiPHA, available at http://www.fao.org/ag/aga/glipha. Open table in a new tab Unregulated (illegal or informal) trade is, by its nature, difficult to quantify, although available data for some regions of the world show that unregulated trade is substantial. Although there are no official records, it has been documented that, for example, 75 000 head of cattle move from Somalia to Kenya annually, and that up to 850 000 goats move from Somalia to the Middle East (which accounts for >95% of all goat imports from the eastern Africa region) [8Little, P. (2005) Unofficial trade when States are weak: the case of cross-border commerce in the Horn of Africa (research paper of UNU-WIDER No. 2005/13). Expert Group on Development Issues (EGDI), World Institute for Development Economics Research (WIDER), United Nations University. http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/publications.htmGoogle Scholar]. Indeed, in the case of cattle trading with Kenya, political instability resulted in a large increase in the value of unofficial trade. This coincided with a collapse in the animal health infrastructure of Somalia and a resulting lack of animal export controls. Diseases known to have been circulating in Somalia include both zoonotic and non-zoonotic infectious diseases: anthrax, babesiosis, brucellosis, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, contagious caprine pleuropneumonia, foot and mouth disease (FMD), heartwater, peste des petits ruminants, rabies, Rift Valley fever, rinderpest and trypanosomiasis, among others [9Food and Agriculture Organization (2004) Somalia: towards a livestock sector strategy \u2013 final report (Report No. 04/001 IC\u2013SOM) FAO/World Bank/European Union http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SOMALIAEXTN/Resources/so_LS_final_rpt.pdfGoogle Scholar]. Unofficially traded animals are a much greater risk factor for disease spread because they are not necessarily subject to veterinary controls. It has been reported that much of the human brucellosis problem in Saudi Arabia, which has an incidence of 40 cases per 100 000 people nationally, is the result of unscreened and unregulated imports that come mainly from Africa [10Memish Z. Brucellosis control in Saudi Arabia: prospects and challenges.J. Chemother. 2001; 13: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar]. The picture that emerges from a consideration of these various data sources is one of a highly interconnected world in which animals move locally, regionally and across large international distances. The global wildlife trade is also huge, with an annual turnover estimated at billions of dollars and involving hundreds of millions of individual plants and animals (http://www.traffic.org/25/wild1.htm). Precise estimates of its scale are difficult because much is conducted through informal or illegal networks but recent figures suggest that \u223c40 000 live primates, four million live birds, 640 000 live reptiles and 350 million live tropical fish are traded globally each year [11Karesh W.B. et al.Wildlife trade and global disease emergence.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2005; 11: 1000-1002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. In Asia, the substantial regional trade in wild animals is estimated to result in several billion direct and indirect contacts among wildlife, humans and domestic animals each year [11Karesh W.B. et al.Wildlife trade and global disease emergence.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2005; 11: 1000-1002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Despite the widespread recognition of the risks of disease transmission associated with wildlife translocation, and the legislation and regulation in place to minimize disease risks [4Cooper M.E. Rosser A.M. International regulation of wildlife trade: relevant legislation and organisations.Rev. Sci. Tech. 2002; 21: 103-123PubMed Google Scholar, 12Woodford M.H. International disease implications for wildlife translocation.J. Zoo Wildl. Med. 1993; 24: 265-270Google Scholar, 13Cunningham A.A. Disease risks of wildlife translocations.Conserv. Biol. 1996; 10: 349-353Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 14Daszak P. et al.Emerging infectious diseases of wildlife \u2013 threats to biodiversity and human health.Science. 2000; 287: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar], new diseases continue to emerge as a result of wildlife trade. Here, we present key examples from the past five years that illustrate the continuing threat to human, livestock and wildlife health. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (e.g. H5N1) are emerging infections that have the potential for pandemic spread with massive public health and economic consequences. Both diseases are maintained in wildlife reservoir hosts: H5N1 in wild fowl and SARS in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus species) in China [15Li W. et al.Bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-like Coronaviruses.Science. 2005; 310: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar, 16Lau S.K. et al.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-like virus in Chinese horseshoe bats.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14040-14045Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar]. For SARS, the trade in bats is likely to have brought infected animals into contact with susceptible amplifying hosts such as the masked palm civet (Parguma larvata) at some point in the wildlife supply chain, establishing a market cycle in which susceptible people and animals could subsequently become infected [15Li W. et al.Bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-like Coronaviruses.Science. 2005; 310: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar, 16Lau S.K. et al.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-like virus in Chinese horseshoe bats.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14040-14045Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar]. For avian influenza, these 'wet markets' could also function as network hubs for potential cross-species transmission. However, the international trade in birds also poses considerable risks for long-distance transmission of H5N1, as highlighted by the detection of infected hawk eagles imported illegally from Thailand to Belgium [17Van Borm S. et al.Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in smuggled Thai eagles, Belgium.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2005; 11: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar]. The disease risks of the wild bird trade have been brought into sharp relief by the importation of H5N1-infected birds destined for the UK pet market [18National Emergency Epidemiology GroupEpidemiology Report on Avian Influenza in a Quarantine Premises in Essex. Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (UK), 2005Google Scholar] and, at the time of submission of this review, a temporary ban on the importation of wild birds had been implemented by the UK government. The recent detection of Pseudamphistomum truncatum (an opisthorchid fluke parasite) in the English otter population has been linked with the introduction of two freshwater fishes: the sunbleak (Leucaspius delineatus) and the topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva), which can function as intermediate hosts for the fluke. These species were newly introduced into the UK by an ornamental fish supplier in Hampshire in the mid-1980s and their escape led to the colonization of many river systems in southern England [19Pinder A.C. Gozlan R.E. Sunbleak and topmouth gudgeon - two new additions to Britain's freshwater fishes.British Wildlife. 2003; 15: 77-83Google Scholar]. The translocation of amphibians is implicated in the emergence of amphibian diseases such as chytridiomycosis and ranavirus infections, which might be a major contributing factor in the widespread decline and extinction of amphibian species worldwide [20Daszak P. et al.Emerging infectious diseases and amphibian population declines.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1999; 5: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar]. Chytridiomycosis, which has been associated with amphibian mortalities and population declines in Central America and Australia, has also been linked to the introduction of cane toads (Bufo marinus) into Australia [20Daszak P. et al.Emerging infectious diseases and amphibian population declines.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1999; 5: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar]. Also, chytridiomycosis has appeared recently in the UK, with confirmed cases in an established breeding population of North American bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), which is an introduced species [21Cunningham A.A. et al.Emergence of amphibian chytridiomycosis in Britain.Vet. Rec. 2005; 157: 386-387PubMed Google Scholar]. Recent movements of R. catesbeiana and B. marinus might also have disseminated ranaviral diseases such as tadpole oedema virus [20Daszak P. et al.Emerging infectious diseases and amphibian population declines.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1999; 5: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar]. In Australia, where B. marinus was introduced to Queensland in 1935, ranaviral antibodies can be identified in this species throughout its geographic range [22Zupanovic Z. et al.Giant toads Bufo marinus in Australia and Venezuela have antibodies against 'ranaviruses'.Dis. Aquat. Organ. 1998; 32: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar]. In addition to the well-recognized threat that animal translocations and invasions into new geographic areas pose for species extinctions and biodiversity, the large wildlife trade clearly poses great dangers for the emergence of human and animal pathogens. It is doubtful whether the disease risks associated with the international wildlife trade, let alone additional welfare and conservation-related problems, can ever be justified simply to supply a demand for pets or recreational hunting. The dilemma is perhaps more acute in areas where the wildlife trade is associated with food and medicines, particularly in Asia, where the trade could be an important element in rural livelihoods and food security. In addition, translocation of wildlife can be an important tool for both conservation and animal welfare. In February 2000, the UK adopted the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) to enable pets with the appropriate documentation to move between the UK and certain countries. This represented the first major change in UK quarantine regulations since the 1901 Importation of Dogs Act. The scheme is primarily designed to prevent the importation of rabies, with secondary measures to prevent the introduction of the cestode parasite Echinococcus multilocularis, which is currently endemic in continental Europe and can be transmitted from canids to humans to cause potentially fatal alveolar echinococcosis. Eighty-one countries now qualify under the scheme but quarantine remains the only option for non-listed countries. The PETS is a model for the use of legislation to minimize risks: the risks of importing rabies under the scheme are small. However, other zoonotic diseases continue to pose a substantial risk and there are few formal checks for these under the system. Figure 1 shows the volume of dog and cat movements into the UK following the introduction of the PETS. Leishmania infantum is the predominant cause of both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis throughout the Mediterranean region, including southern France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey and North Africa [23Trotz-Williams L.A. Trees A.J. Systematic review of the distribution of the major vector-borne parasitic infections in dogs and cats in Europe.Vet. Rec. 2003; 152: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar]; the main reservoir host is the domestic dog. Seropositivity rates of canine leishmaniasis can be >30% [24Ferroglio E. et al.Canine leishmaniasis, Italy.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2005; 11: 1618-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar] in the Mediterranean, with patterns of infection that reflect the distribution of the sand fly vector (Phelobotomus species) [25Trees A. Shaw S. Imported diseases in small animals.In Pract. 1999; 21: 482-491Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Bongiorno G. et al.Host preferences of phlebotomine sand flies at a hypoendemic focus of canine leishmaniasis in central Italy.Acta Trop. 2003; 88: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar]. In Brazil, where canine visceral leishmaniasis is an important emerging disease, canine infection in endemic areas can be as high as 67% [27Moreira E.D. et al.Assessment of an optimized dog-culling program in the dynamics of canine Leishmania transmission.Vet. Parasitol. 2004; 122: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar]. To control the disease, a mass culling of seropositive dogs has been adopted in several areas but has not been effective [28Courtenay O. et al.Infectiousness in a cohort of Brazilian dogs: why culling fails to control visceral leishmaniasis in areas of high transmission.J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 1314-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar]. A feasible alternative to culling dogs is to fit collars treated with the insecticide deltamethrin; preliminary results have shown a large drop in the number of bites by sand flies and infection rates in dogs [29Halbig P. et al.Further evidence that deltamethrin-impregnated collars protect domestic dogs from sandfly bites.Med. Vet. Entomol. 2000; 14: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Killick-Kendrick R. et al.Protection of dogs from bites of phlebotomine sandflies by deltamethrin collars for control of canine leishmaniasis.Med. Vet. Entomol. 1997; 11: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 31Reithinger R. et al.Are insecticide-impregnated dog collars a feasible alternative to dog culling as a strategy for controlling canine visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil?.Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar]. This might be the only way to control the increasing spread of canine visceral leishmaniasis and could be recommended as a control measure for dogs leaving and re-entering the UK under PETS. Quarantine is not effective in preventing the introduction of leishmaniasis due to the long incubation period of the disease. Outbreaks of leishmaniasis have occurred in dogs in the USA as a result of Mediterranean-based military personnel who have returned home with their pets. In addition, there has been an apparent increase in the incidence of leishmaniasis in US hunting dogs [32Enserink M. Infectious diseases \u2013 has Leishmaniasis become endemic in the US?.Science. 2000; 290: 1881-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar] \u2013 although the cause remains unclear, it could be a result of either animal movements or spread of the vector. The chances of leishmaniasis becoming established in domestic dogs in the UK are small because, currently, Phelobotomus species are not known to be present in the UK. However, if climate change does affect air temperatures substantially, the sand fly vector could become established in the UK and, potentially, could maintain endemic leishmaniasis and other 'exotic' parasitic diseases [33Martens W.J.M. et al.Sensitivity of malaria, schistosomiasis and dengue to global warming.Clim. Change. 1997; 35: 145-156Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar], the introduction of which would probably result from the movement of domestic pets. In addition to leishmaniasis, diseases such as heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis), babesiosis (Babesia canis), ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia canis) and echinococcosis (Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis) are all likely to be moved with domestic pets into the UK and elsewhere [23Trotz-Williams L.A. Trees A.J. Systematic review of the distribution of the major vector-borne parasitic infections in dogs and cats in Europe.Vet. Rec. 2003; 152: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 34Genchi C. et al.Is heartworm disease really spreading in Europe?.Vet. Parasitol. 2005; 133: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar]. The responsibility falls on domestic pet owners in such a situation who should ensure the use of anthelminthics \u2013 agents that destroy or expel parasitic intestinal worms \u2013 and, possibly, insecticide-treated collars. Owners should also be advised about preventative measures before pet travel. E. multilocularis is common in red foxes in Hokkaido, northern Japan, where the prevalence of infection in foxes is as high as 40% and high worm burdens are recorded in some individuals [35Konno K. et al.Prevention of alveolar echinococcosis \u2013 ecosystem and risk management perspectives in Japan.Acta Trop. 2003; 89: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar]. DNA sequencing of parasite isolates from this area show that it was probably introduced in the 1960s from a neighbouring island [36Satoh M. et al.Short report: Echinococcus multilocularis confirmed on Kunashiri Island, 15 kilometers from the eastern part of Hokkaido, Japan.Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2005; 72: 284-288PubMed Google Scholar] through the movement of infected foxes. This disease now presents an important public health problem, with a human incidence of 0.33 per 100 000 people [35Konno K. et al.Prevention of alveolar echinococcosis \u2013 ecosystem and risk management perspectives in Japan.Acta Trop. 2003; 89: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar], or \u223c10 cases annually. Domestic dogs have become part of the transmission cycle and close contact between humans and their pets is a major risk factor. A recent risk analysis [37Doi R. et al.Nippon Koshu Eisei Zasshi. 2003; 50: 639-649PubMed Google Scholar] showed that the movement of pet animals between Hokkaido and the rest of Japan is likely to result in further geographical spread of the parasite, particularly because there are few movement controls or programmes for screening and treatment. Rabies is a prime example of an infectious disease in which transmission can be enhanced by animal movements. Flores Island in Indonesia was free of rabies until 1997 [38Windiyaningsih C. et al.The rabies epidemic on Flores Island, Indonesia (1998\u20132003).J. Med. Assoc. Thai. 2004; 87: 1389-1393PubMed Google Scholar]; in that year, three dogs were imported from a rabies-endemic area and this was sufficient to result in 113 human deaths (mainly children) and the culling of almost 50% of the dog population in some areas as part of an unsuccessful control campaign [39Bingham J. Rabies on Flores Island, Indonesia: is eradication possible in the near future?.in: Dodet B. Meslin F.-X. Fourth International Symposium on Rabies Control in Asia.

    "title": "Infectious Disease Threats in the Twenty-First Century: Strengthening the Global Response",
    "abstract_text": "The world has developed an elaborate global health system as a bulwark against known and unknown infectious disease threats. The system consists of various formal and informal networks of organizations that serve different stakeholders; have varying goals, modalities, resources, and accountability; operate at different regional levels (e.g., local, national, and global); and cut across the public, private-for-profit, and private-not-for-profit sectors. The evolving global health system has done much to protect and promote human health. However, the world continues to be confronted by longstanding, emerging, and reemerging infectious disease threats. These threats differ widely in terms of severity and probability. They also have varying consequences for morbidity and mortality, as well as for a complex set of social and economic outcomes. To various degrees, they are also amenable to alternative responses, ranging from clean water provision to regulation to biomedical countermeasures. Whether the global health system as currently constituted can provide effective protection against a dynamic array of infectious disease threats has been called into question by recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, dengue, Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and influenza and by the looming threat of rising antimicrobial resistance. The concern is magnified by rapid population growth in areas with weak health systems, urbanization, globalization, climate change, civil conflict, and the changing nature of pathogen transmission between human and animal populations. There is also potential for human-originated outbreaks emanating from laboratory accidents or intentional biological attacks. This paper discusses these issues, along with the need for a (possibly self-standing) multi-disciplinary Global Technical Council on Infectious Disease Threats to address emerging global challenges with regard to infectious disease and associated social and economic risks. This Council would strengthen the global health system by improving collaboration and coordination across organizations (e.g., the WHO, Gavi, CEPI, national centers for disease control, pharmaceutical manufacturers, etc.); filling in knowledge gaps with respect to (for example) infectious disease surveillance, research and development needs, financing models, supply chain logistics, and the social and economic impacts of potential threats; and making high-level, evidence-based recommendations for managing global risks associated with infectious disease.",

    "abstract_text": "Assay validation is a series of the following interrelated processes: -an experimental process: reagents and protocols are optimised by experimentation to detect the analyte with accuracy and precision, and to ensure repeatability and reproducibility in the assay -a relative process: its diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic specificity are calculated relative to test results obtained from reference animal populations of known infection/exposure status -a conditional process: classification of animals in the target population as infected or uninfected is conditional upon how well the reference animal population used to validate the assay represents the population to which the assay will be applied (accurate predictions of the infection status of animals from test results and predictive values of positive and negative test results are conditional upon the estimated prevalence of disease/infection in the target population) -an incremental process: confidence in the validity of an assay increases over time when use confirms that it is robust as demonstrated by accurate and precise results (the assay may also achieve increasing levels of validity as it is upgraded and extended by adding reference populations of known infection status) -a continuous process: the assay remains valid only insofar as the assay continues to provide accurate and precise results as proved through statistical verification.Therefore, validation of diagnostic assays for infectious diseases does not end with a time-limited series of experiments based on a few reference samples.Rather, it is a process that also requires constant vigilance and maintenance, along with reassessment of its performance characteristics for each population of animals to which it is applied.It is certain that the current movement to develop and implement accreditation criteria for veterinary diagnostic laboratories may be of little worth unless there is some assurance that the assays conducted in such laboratories are properly validated.Fully accredited laboratories may generate highly reproducible test results, but the results may still misclassify animals as to their infection status due to an improper assay validation process.Therefore, assay validation is foundational to the core product of veterinary diagnostic laboratories -test results and their interpretation.",

    "abstract_text": "The development of chronic infections and cancer is facilitated by a variety of immune subversion mechanisms, such as the production of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines, induction of regulatory T (Treg) cells, and expression of immune checkpoint molecules, including CTLA\u20104 and PD\u20101. CTLA\u20104, expressed on T cells, interacts with CD80/CD86, thereby limiting T\u2010cell activation and leading to anergy. PD\u20101 is predominantly expressed on T cells and its interaction with PD\u2010L1 and PD\u2010L2 expressed on antigen\u2010presenting cells (APCs) and tumors sends a negative signal to T cells, which can lead to T\u2010cell exhaustion. Given their role in suppressing effector T\u2010cell responses, immune checkpoints are being targeted for the treatment of cancer. Indeed, antibodies binding to CTLA\u20104, PD\u20101, or PD\u2010L1 have shown remarkable efficacy, especially in combination therapies, for a number of cancers and have been licensed for the treatment of melanoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and renal and bladder cancers. Moreover, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to enhance ex vivo effector T\u2010cell responses from patients with chronic viral, bacterial, or parasitic infection, including HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. Although the data from clinical trials in infectious diseases are still sparse, these inhibitors have great potential for treating chronic infections, especially when combined with therapeutic vaccines.",

Excellent sensitivity, specificity, and speed have made molecular assays an attractive alternative to culture or enzyme immunoassay methods. Many molecular assays are commercially available and FDA approved. Others, especially those that test for less common analytes, are often laboratory developed. Laboratories also often modify FDA-approved assays to include different extraction systems or additional specimen types. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) federal regulatory standards require clinical laboratories to establish and document their own performance specifications for laboratory-developed tests to ensure accurate and precise results prior to implementation of the test. The performance characteristics that must be established include accuracy, precision, reportable range, reference interval, analytical sensitivity, and analytical specificity. Clinical laboratories are challenged to understand the requirements and determine the types of experiments and analyses necessary to meet the requirements. A variety of protocols and guidelines are available in various texts and documents. Many of the guidelines are general and more appropriate for assays in chemistry sections of the laboratory but are applied in principle to molecular assays. This review presents information that laboratories may consider in their efforts to meet regulatory requirements.",

    "abstract_text": "Due to emergence of new variants of pathogenic micro-organisms the treatment and immunization of infectious diseases have become a great challenge in the past few years. In the context of vaccine development remarkable efforts have been made to develop new vaccines and also to improve the efficacy of existing vaccines against specific diseases. To date, some vaccines are developed from protein subunits or killed pathogens, whilst several vaccines are based on live-attenuated organisms, which carry the risk of regaining their pathogenicity under certain immunocompromised conditions. To avoid this, the development of risk-free effective vaccines in conjunction with adequate delivery systems are considered as an imperative need to obtain desired humoral and cell-mediated immunity against infectious diseases. In the last several years, the use of nanoparticle-based vaccines has received a great attention to improve vaccine efficacy, immunization strategies, and targeted delivery to achieve desired immune responses at the cellular level. To improve vaccine efficacy, these nanocarriers should protect the antigens from premature proteolytic degradation, facilitate antigen uptake and processing by antigen presenting cells, control release, and should be safe for human use. Nanocarriers composed of lipids, proteins, metals or polymers have already been used to attain some of these attributes. In this context, several physico-chemical properties of nanoparticles play an important role in the determination of vaccine efficacy. This review article focuses on the applications of nanocarrier-based vaccine formulations and the strategies used for the functiona-lization of nanoparticles to accomplish efficient delivery of vaccines in order to induce desired host immunity against infectious diseases.",

An epidemiological study was performed, and the medical records for all patients who were in the unit during the second half of April were assessed. The only identified risk factor for S. cerevisiae infection was treatment with a probiotic containing Saccharomyces boulardii (Ultralevura; Bristol-Myers Squibb). This probiotic is used in Europe for the treatment and prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. The 3 patients received the product via nasograstric tube for a mean duration of 8.5 days before the culture result was positive, whereas only 2 of 41 control subjects had received it. Surveillance cultures for the control patients admitted at the same time did not reveal any carriers of the yeast. Strains from the probiotic capsules and the clinical isolates were identified as S. cerevisiae, with identical DNA fingerprinting. Discontinuation of use of the product in the unit stopped the outbreak of infection. A review of the literature identified another 57 cases of S. cerevisiae fungemia. Overall, 60% of these patients were in the ICU, and 71% were receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition. Use of probiotics was detected in 26 patients, and 17 patients died.

Subsequently, in what became known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events. This empirical rule was shown to govern inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders. Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events, most individuals infect few, if any, secondary contacts. The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers. Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans.",

    "abstract_text": "Recent theoretical and empirical studies of the population biology of infectious diseases have helped to improve our understanding of the major factors that influence the three phases of a successful invasion, namely initial establishment, persistence in the longer term and spread to other host communities. Of central importance in all three phases is the magnitude of the basic reproductive rate or transmission potential of the parasite. The value of this parameter is determined by a variety of biological properties of the association between an individual parasite and its host and the interaction between their populations. The recent epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in North America and Europe is employed to illustrate the factors that promote disease establishment and spread. The frequency distribution of the number of different sexual partners per unit of time within homosexual communities is shown to be of central importance with respect to future trends in the incidence of AIDS. Broader aspects of pathogen invasion are examined by reference to simple mathematical models of three species associations, which mirror parasite introduction into resident predator-prey, host-parasite and competitive interactions. Many outcomes are possible, depending on the values of the numerous parameters that influence multi-species population interactions. Pathogen invasion is shown to have far-reaching implications for the structure and stability of ecological communities.",

This document, developed by experts in laboratory and adult and pediatric clinical medicine, provides information on which tests are valuable and in which contexts, and on tests that add little or no value for diagnostic decisions. This document presents a system-based approach rather than specimen-based approach, and includes bloodstream and cardiovascular system infections, central nervous system infections, ocular infections, soft tissue infections of the head and neck, upper and lower respiratory infections, infections of the gastrointestinal tract, intra-abdominal infections, bone and joint infections, urinary tract infections, genital infections, and other skin and soft tissue infections; or into etiologic agent groups, including arthropod-borne infections, viral syndromes, and blood and tissue parasite infections. Each section contains introductory concepts, a summary of key points, and detailed tables that list suspected agents; the most reliable tests to order; the samples (and volumes) to collect in order of preference; specimen transport devices, procedures, times, and temperatures; and detailed notes on specific issues regarding the test methods, such as when tests are likely to require a specialized laboratory or have prolonged turnaround times. In addition, the pediatric needs of specimen management are also emphasized. There is intentional redundancy among the tables and sections, as many agents and assay choices overlap. The document is intended to serve as a guidance for physicians in choosing tests that will aid them to quickly and accurately diagnose infectious diseases in their patients.",

Some observations about seasonality are difficult to reconcile with these explanations. These include the simultaneous appearance of outbreaks across widespread geographic regions of the same latitude; the detection of pathogens in the off-season without epidemic spread; and the consistency of seasonal changes, despite wide variations in weather and human behavior. In contrast, an increase in susceptibility of the host population, perhaps linked to the annual light/dark cycle and mediated by the pattern of melatonin secretion, might account for many heretofore unexplained features of infectious disease seasonality. Ample evidence indicates that photoperiod-driven physiologic changes are typical in mammalian species, including some in humans. If such physiologic changes underlie human resistance to infectious diseases for large portions of the year and the changes can be identified and modified, the therapeutic and preventive implications may be considerable.",

The sequencing of human and microbial genomes and advances in functional genomics will underpin significant progress in many areas, including understanding human predisposition and susceptibility to disease, microbial pathogenesis, and the development new diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies.

Starting from a definition of concurrency on the level of individuals, the authors define ways to quantify concurrency on the population level. An index of concurrency based on graph theoretical considerations is introduced, and the way in which it is related to the degree distribution of the contact graph is demonstrated. Then the spread of an infectious disease on a dynamic partnership network is investigated. The model is based on a stochastic process of pair formation and separation and a process of disease transmission within partnerships of susceptible and infected individuals. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the spread of the epidemic is compared for contact patterns ranging from serial monogamy to situations where individuals can have many partners simultaneously. It is found that for a fixed mean number of partners per individual the distribution of these partnerships over the population has a major influence on the speed of the epidemic in its initial phase and consequently in the number of individuals who are infected after a certain time period.",

Climate-related impacts on marine diseases are being documented in corals, shellfish, finfish, and humans; these impacts are less clearly linked for other organisms. Oceans and people are inextricably linked, and marine diseases can both directly and indirectly affect human health, livelihoods, and well-being. We recommend an adaptive management approach to better increase the resilience of ocean systems vulnerable to marine diseases in a changing climate. Land-based management methods of quarantining, culling, and vaccinating are not successful in the ocean; therefore, forecasting conditions that lead to outbreaks and designing tools/approaches to influence these conditions may be the best way to manage marine disease.",

By increasing their hsp content, cells protect themselves from lethal assaults, primarily because hsp interfere with the uncontrolled protein unfolding that occurs under stress. However, hsp are not produced only by stressed cells; some hsp are synthesized constitutively and perform important housekeeping functions. Accordingly, hsp are involved in the assembly of molecules which play important roles in the immune system. It is not surprising that due to their wide distribution and their homology among different species, hsp represent target antigens of the immune response. Frequent confrontation of the immune system with conserved regions of hsp which are shared by various microbial pathogens can potentiate antimicrobial immunity. However, long-term confrontation of the immune system with hsp antigens which are similar in the host and invaders may convert the immune response against these host antigens and promote autoimmune disease. This review provides an overview of the role of hsp in immunity with a focus on infectious and autoimmune diseases.",

Yet, a rate-limiting step in achieving normal nutrition may be impaired absorptive function due to multiple repeated enteric infections. This is especially problematic in children whose diets are marginal. In malnourished individuals, the infections are even more devastating. This review documents the evidence that intestinal infections lead to malnutrition and that malnutrition worsens intestinal infections. The clinical data presented here derive largely from long-term cohort studies that are supported by controlled animal studies. Also reviewed are the mechanisms by which enteric infections lead to undernutrition and by which malnutrition worsens enteric infections, with implications for potential novel interventions. Further intervention studies are needed to document the relevance of these mechanisms and, most importantly, to interrupt the vicious diarrhea-malnutrition cycle so children may develop their full potential.",

It has been prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and other health-care providers, HIV-infected patients, and policy makers in the United States. These guidelines address several OIs that occur in the United States and five OIs that might be acquired during international travel. Topic areas covered for each OI include epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention of exposure; prevention of disease by chemoprophylaxis and vaccination; discontinuation of primary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution; treatment of disease; monitoring for adverse effects during treatment; management of treatment failure; prevention of disease recurrence; discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution; and special considerations during pregnancy. These guidelines were developed by a panel of specialists from the United States government and academic institutions. For each OI, a small group of specialists with content-matter expertise reviewed the literature for new information since the guidelines were last published; they then proposed revised recommendations at a meeting held at NIH in June 2007. After these presentations and discussion, the revised guidelines were further reviewed by the co-editors; by the Office of AIDS Research, NIH; by specialists at CDC; and by HIVMA of IDSA before final approval and publication. The recommendations are rated by a letter that indicates the strength of the recommendation and a Roman numeral that indicates the quality of evidence supporting the recommendation, so that readers can ascertain how best to apply the recommendations in their practice environments. Major changes in the guidelines include 1) greater emphasis on the importance of antiretroviral therapy for the prevention and treatment of OIs, especially those OIs for which no specific therapy exists; 2) information regarding the diagnosis and management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes; 3) information regarding the use of interferon-gamma release assays for the diagnosis of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection; 4) updated information concerning drug interactions that affect the use of rifamycin drugs for prevention and treatment of TB; 5) the addition of a section on hepatitis B virus infection; and 6) the addition of malaria to the list of OIs that might be acquired during international travel. This report includes eleven tables pertinent to the prevention and treatment of OIs, a figure that pertains to the diagnois of tuberculosis, a figure that describes immunization recommendations, and an appendix that summarizes recommendations for prevention of exposure to opportunistic pathogens.",

These free-living swine are known reservoirs for a number of viruses, bacteria and parasites that are transmissible to domestic animals and humans. Changes of human habitation to suburban areas, increased use of lands for agricultural purposes, increased hunting activities and consumption of wild boar meat have increased the chances of exposure of wild boars to domestic animals and humans. Wild boars can act as reservoirs for many important infectious diseases in domestic animals, such as classical swine fever, brucellosis and trichinellosis, and in humans, diseases such as hepatitis E, tuberculosis, leptospirosis and trichinellosis. For examples, wild boars are reservoirs for hepatitis E virus, and cluster cases of hepatitis E have been reported in Japan of humans who consumed wild boar meat. In Canada, an outbreak of trichinellosis was linked to the consumption of wild boar meat. The incidence of tuberculosis owing to Mycobacterium bovis has increased in wild boars, thus posing a potential concern for infections in livestock and humans. It has also been documented that six hunters contracted Brucella suis infections from wild swine in Florida. This article discusses the prevalence and risk of infectious agents in wild boars and their potential transmission to livestock and humans.",

Distinct immune strategies to achieve this balance have evolved in females and males and also in infancy through to adulthood. Sex differences in outcome from a range of infectious diseases can be identified from as early as fetal life, such as in congenital cytomegalovirus infection. The impact of sex hormones on the T-helper 1/T-helper 2 cytokine balance has been proposed to explain the higher severity of most infectious diseases in males. In the minority where greater morbidity and mortality is observed in females, this is hypothesized to arise because of greater immunopathology and/or autoimmunity. However, a number of unexplained exceptions to this rule are described. Studies that have actually measured the sex differences in children in the immune responses to infectious diseases and that would further test these hypotheses, are relatively scarce.",

Although the association between malnutrition and all-cause mortality is well documented, the malnutrition-related risk of death associated with specific diseases is less well described. We reviewed published literature to examine the evidence for a relation between malnutrition and child mortality from diarrhoea, acute respiratory illness, malaria and measles, conditions that account for over 50% of deaths in children worldwide.MEDLINE was searched for suitable review articles and original reports of community-based and hospital-based studies. Findings from cohort studies and case-control studies were reviewed and summarized.The strongest and most consistent relation between malnutrition and an increased risk of death was observed for diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection. The evidence, although limited, also suggests a potentially increased risk for death from malaria. A less consistent association was observed between nutritional status and death from measles. Although some hospital-based studies and case-control studies reported an increased risk of mortality from measles, few community-based studies reported any association.The risk of malnutrition-related mortality seems to vary for different diseases. These findings have important implications for the evaluation of nutritional intervention programmes and child survival programmes being implemented in settings with different disease profiles.",

The mouth has a variety of features which have enabled it to serve as a useful model for the discovery of basic principles of host-parasite interactions occurring in mucosal environments. Early studies demonstrated that indigenous bacteria attach to surfaces of the mouth in a highly selective manner; attachment was often observed to correlate with colonization. These studies led to the recognition that bacterial attachment is an essential step for colonization in environments which contain surfaces exposed to a fluid flow. Bacterial adhesion has subsequently grown into a major area of infectious disease research. Many bacteria have been found to possess proteinaceous components, called \"adhesins\", on their surfaces which bind in a stereochemically specific manner to complementary molecules, or \"receptors\", on the tissue surface. Adhesins are often lectins which bind to saccharide receptors, but some adhesins are thought to bind to proteinaceous receptors. Studies of components of human saliva, which adsorb to hydroxyapatite (HA) surfaces similar to those of teeth, and promote the attachment of prominent plaque bacteria, have revealed that the acidic proline-rich proteins (PRPs) promote the attachment of several important bacteria. These include strains of Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides gingival is, some strains of Streptococcus mutans, and others. The salivary PRP's are a unique family of molecules. However, segments of PRPs are structurally related to collagen. This may be significant, since B. gingivalis and certain cariogenic streptococci bind to collagenous substrata, and such interactions may facilitate their invasion into gingival tissues, or into dentin or cementum, respectively. Another unexpected observation was that although A. viscosus and other bacteria bind avidly to PRPs adsorbed onto apatitic surfaces, they do not interact with PRPs in solution. PRP molecules evidently undergo a conformational change when they adsorb to HA, and adhesins of A. viscosus recognize cryptic segments which are only exposed in adsorbed molecules. This provides the bacteria with a mechanism for efficiently attaching to teeth while suspended in saliva. It also offers a molecular explanation for their sharp tropisms for human teeth. It has proven convenient to refer to such hidden receptors for bacterial adhesins as \"cryptitopes\" (from cryptic, meaning hidden, and topo, meaning place). The generation of cryptitopes due to conformational changes or because of enzymatic modifications appears to be involved in the colonization of several bacteria on mucosal surfaces. In addition, there is evidence which suggests that elevated levels of neuraminidases and proteases associated with poor oral hygiene and gingivitis may also generate cryptitopes which promote colonization of certain Gram-negative bacteria associated with destructive periodontal diseases. These enzymes concurrently destroy receptors required for attachment of relatively benign species such as S. mitis and S. sanguis. Thus, the elevated levels of enzymes previously reported present in crevicular fluid and saliva of individuals with poor oral hygiene appear to have the potential to modulate bacterial colonization.",

    "abstract_text": "When the adaptive immune response is either immature or compromised, the innate immune system constitutes the principle defense against infection. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a C-type serum lectin that plays a central role in the innate immune response. MBL binds microbial surface carbohydrates and mediates opsonophagocytosis directly and by activation of the lectin complement pathway. A wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites are bound by MBL. Three polymorphisms in the structural gene MBL2) and 2 promoter gene polymorphisms are commonly found that result in production of low serum levels of MBL. Clinical studies have shown that MBL insufficiency is associated with bacterial infection in patients with neutropenia and meningococcal sepsis. Low MBL levels appear to predispose persons to HIV infection. Numerous other potential infectious disease associations have been described. Therapy to supplement low MBL levels is being explored using either plasma-derived or recombinant material.",

Some observations about seasonality are difficult to reconcile with these explanations. These include the simultaneous appearance of outbreaks across widespread geographic regions of the same latitude; the detection of pathogens in the off-season without epidemic spread; and the consistency of seasonal changes, despite wide variations in weather and human behavior. In contrast, an increase in susceptibility of the host population, perhaps linked to the annual light/dark cycle and mediated by the pattern of melatonin secretion, might account for many heretofore unexplained features of infectious disease seasonality. Ample evidence indicates that photoperiod-driven physiologic changes are typical in mammalian species, including some in humans. If such physiologic changes underlie human resistance to infectious diseases for large portions of the year and the changes can be identified and modified, the therapeutic and preventive implications may be considerable.",

Nucleic acid techniques, such as plasmid profiling, various methods for generating restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are making increasing inroads into clinical laboratories. PCR-based systems to detect the etiologic agents of disease directly from clinical samples, without the need for culture, have been useful in rapid detection of unculturable or fastidious microorganisms. Additionally, sequence analysis of amplified microbial DNA allows for identification and better characterization of the pathogen. Subspecies variation, identified by various techniques, has been shown to be important in the prognosis of certain diseases. Other important advances include the determination of viral load and the direct detection of genes or gene mutations responsible for drug resistance. Increased use of automation and user-friendly software makes these technologies more widely available. In all, the detection of infectious agents at the nucleic acid level represents a true synthesis of clinical chemistry and clinical microbiology techniques.",

Treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The guideline did not address children and some adult populations, including patients with neutropenia, solid organ transplants, and nonurologic surgery. In the years since the publication of the guideline, further information relevant to ASB has become available. In addition, antimicrobial treatment of ASB has been recognized as an important contributor to inappropriate antimicrobial use, which promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The current guideline updates the recommendations of the 2005 guideline, includes new recommendations for populations not previously addressed, and, where relevant, addresses the interpretation of nonlocalizing clinical symptoms in populations with a high prevalence of ASB.",

    "abstract_text": "Infectious diseases affect people, domestic animals and wildlife alike, with many pathogens being able to infect multiple species. Fifty years ago, following the wide-scale manufacture and use of antibiotics and vaccines, it seemed that the battle against infections was being won for the human population. Since then, however, and in addition to increasing antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens, there has been an increase in the emergence of, mostly viral, zoonotic diseases from wildlife, sometimes causing fatal outbreaks of epidemic proportions. Concurrently, infectious disease has been identified as an increasing threat to wildlife conservation. A synthesis published in 2000 showed common anthropogenic drivers of disease threats to biodiversity and human health, including encroachment and destruction of wildlife habitat and the human-assisted spread of pathogens. Almost two decades later, the situation has not changed and, despite improved knowledge of the underlying causes, little has been done at the policy level to address these threats. For the sake of public health and wellbeing, human-kind needs to work better to conserve nature and preserve the ecosystem services, including disease regulation, that biodiversity provides while also understanding and mitigating activities which lead to disease emergence. We consider that holistic, One Health approaches to the management and mitigation of the risks of emerging infectious diseases have the greatest chance of success.This article is part of the themed issue 'One Health for a changing world: zoonoses, ecosystems and human well-being'.",

A complex interplay between immune cell activity and IFN-\u03b3 through coordinated integration of signals from other pathways involving cytokines and Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) such as Interleukin (IL)-4, TNF-\u03b1, Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Type-I Interferons (IFNS) etc. leads to initiation of a cascade of pro-inflammatory responses. Microarray data has unraveled numerous genes whose transcriptional regulation is influenced by IFN-\u03b3. Consequently, IFN-\u03b3 stimulated cells display altered expression of many such target genes which mediate its downstream effector functions. The importance of IFN-\u03b3 is further reinforced by the fact that mice possessing disruptions in the IFN-\u03b3 gene or its receptor develop extreme susceptibility to infectious diseases and rapidly succumb to them. In this review, we attempt to elucidate the biological functions and physiological importance of this versatile cytokine. The functional implications of its biological activity in several infectious diseases and autoimmune pathologies are also discussed. As a counter strategy, many virulent pathogenic species have devised ways to thwart IFN-\u03b3 endowed immune-protection. Thus, IFN-\u03b3 mediated host-pathogen interactions are critical for our understanding of disease mechanisms and these aspects also manifest enormous therapeutic importance for the annulment of various infections and autoimmune conditions.",

    "abstract_text": "The world is now experiencing an epidemic of obesity. Although the effects of obesity on the development of metabolic and cardiovascular problems are well studied, much less is known about the impact of obesity on immune function and infectious disease. Studies in obese humans and with obese animal models have repeatedly demonstrated impaired immune function, including decreased cytokine production, decreased response to antigen/mitogen stimulation, reduced macrophage and dendritic cell function, and natural killer cell impairment. Recent studies have demonstrated that the impaired immune response in the obese host leads to increased susceptibility to infection with a number of different pathogens such as community-acquired tuberculosis, influenza, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, coxsackievirus, Helicobacter pylori and encephalomyocarditis virus. While no specific mechanism has been defined for the decreased immune response to infectious disease in the obese host, several obesity-associated changes such as excessive inflammation, altered adipokine signaling, metabolic changes and even epigenetic regulation could affect the immune response. This review will discuss what is currently known about the relationship between obesity and infectious disease.",

MMPs facilitate leucocyte recruitment, cytokine and chemokine processing, defensin activation and matrix remodelling. However, excess MMP activity following infection may lead to immunopathology that causes host morbidity or mortality and favours pathogen dissemination or persistence. Here, we review the normal functions of MMPs in immunity and then discuss viral and bacterial infections where excess MMP activity has been implicated in pathology, specifically examining HIV, HTLV-1, hepatitis B, endotoxin shock, Helicobacter pylori and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tissue destruction may be exacerbated further by bacterial-derived enzymes which activate the host pro-MMPs. Finally, the potential for therapeutic targeting of excess MMP activity in infection is considered.",

Data were extracted regarding number of cases in pregnant women, rates of infection, risk factors for disease severity or complications, and maternal outcomes. The evidence indicates that pregnancy is associated with increased severity of some infectious diseases, such as influenza, malaria, hepatitis E, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection (risk for dissemination/hepatitis); there is also some evidence for increased severity of measles and smallpox. Disease severity seems higher with advanced pregnancy. Pregnant women may be more susceptible to acquisition of malaria, HIV infection, and listeriosis, although the evidence is limited. These results reinforce the importance of infection prevention as well as of early identification and treatment of suspected influenza, malaria, hepatitis E, and HSV disease during pregnancy.",

As infectious disease and infection control practitioners continue employing contemporary techniques (e.g., computational fluid dynamics to study particle flow, polymerase chain reaction methodologies to quantify particle concentrations in various settings, and epidemiology to track the spread of disease), the central variables affecting the airborne transmission of pathogens are becoming better known. This paper reviews many of these aerobiological variables (e.g., particle size, particle type, the duration that particles can remain airborne, the distance that particles can travel, and meteorological and environmental factors), as well as the common origins of these infectious particles. We then review several real-world settings with known difficulties controlling the airborne transmission of infectious particles (e.g., office buildings, healthcare facilities, and commercial airplanes), while detailing the respective measures each of these industries is undertaking in its effort to ameliorate the transmission of airborne infectious diseases.",

Many such infections are known to be transmissible by blood transfusion, while others have properties indicating this potential. There has been no comprehensive review of such infectious agents and their threat to transfusion recipient safety to date. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The members of AABB's Transfusion Transmitted Diseases Committee reviewed a large number of information sources in order to identify infectious agents with actual or potential risk of transfusion transmission now or in the future in the US or Canada; with few exceptions, these agents do not have available interventions to reduce the risk of such transmission. Using a group discussion and writing process, key characteristics of each agent were identified, researched, recorded and documented in standardized format. A group process was used to prioritize each agent on the basis of scientific/epidemiologic data and a subjective assessment of public perception and/or concern expressed by regulatory agencies. RESULTS: Sixty\u2010eight infectious agents were identified and are described in detail in a single Supplement to TRANSFUSION . Key information will also be provided in web\u2010based form and updated as necessary. The highest priorities were assigned to Babesia species, Dengue virus, and vCJD. CONCLUSION: The information is expected to support the needs of clinicians and transfusion medicine experts in the recognition and management of emerging infections among blood donors and blood recipients.",

    "abstract_text": "Accurate estimation of the parameters characterising infectious disease transmission is vital for optimising control interventions during epidemics. A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the transmission potential, and hence informing control, during future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.",

Here, we use publicly available data from 101,853 users of online social media collected over a time period of almost six months to measure the spatio-temporal sentiment towards a new vaccine. We validated our approach by identifying a strong correlation between sentiments expressed online and CDC-estimated vaccination rates by region. Analysis of the network of opinionated users showed that information flows more often between users who share the same sentiments - and less often between users who do not share the same sentiments - than expected by chance alone. We also found that most communities are dominated by either positive or negative sentiments towards the novel vaccine. Simulations of infectious disease transmission show that if clusters of negative vaccine sentiments lead to clusters of unprotected individuals, the likelihood of disease outbreaks is greatly increased. Online social media provide unprecedented access to data allowing for inexpensive and efficient tools to identify target areas for intervention efforts and to evaluate their effectiveness.",

We used the IUCN Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species and compiled data on hosts threatened by infectious disease and their parasites to better understand the role of infectious disease in contemporary host extinctions. The majority of mammal species considered threatened by parasites were either carnivores or artiodactyls, two clades that include the majority of domesticated animals. Parasites affecting host threat status were predominantly viruses and bacteria that infect a wide range of host species, including domesticated animals. Counter to our predictions, parasites transmitted by close contact were more likely to cause extinction risk than those transmitted by other routes. Mammal species threatened by parasites were not better studied for infectious diseases than other threatened mammals and did not have more parasites or differ in four key traits demonstrated to affect parasite species richness in other comparative studies. Our findings underscore the need for better information concerning the distribution and impacts of infectious diseases in populations of endangered mammals. In addition, our results suggest that evolutionary similarity to domesticated animals may be a key factor associated with parasite\u2010mediated declines; thus, efforts to limit contact between domesticated hosts and wildlife could reduce extinction risk.",

The update, which has incorporated recommendations for children (following the adult recommendations for epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment), includes significant changes in the management of this infection and reflects the evolving controversy over best methods for diagnosis. Clostridium difficile remains the most important cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and has become the most commonly identified cause of healthcare-associated infection in adults in the United States. Moreover, C. difficile has established itself as an important community pathogen. Although the prevalence of the epidemic and virulent ribotype 027 strain has declined markedly along with overall CDI rates in parts of Europe, it remains one of the most commonly identified strains in the United States where it causes a sizable minority of CDIs, especially healthcare-associated CDIs. This guideline updates recommendations regarding epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, infection prevention, and environmental management.",

Similarly, having \ue4211 viral infection of the herpes type in the first 3 years of life was inversely associated with asthma at age 7 (odds ratio 0.48 (0.26 to 0.89)). Repeated lower respiratory tract infections in the first 3 years of life showed a positive association with wheeze up to the age of 7 years (odds ratio 3.37 (1.92 to 5.92) for \ue4214 infections <i>v</i> \ue4253 infections). <b>Conclusion:</b> Repeated viral infections other than lower respiratory tract infections early in life may reduce the risk of developing asthma up to school age.",

The first epidemiologic transition was associated with a rise in infectious diseases that accompanied the Neolithic Revolution. The second epidemiologic transition involved the shift from infectious to chronic disease mortality associated with industrialization. The recent resurgence of infectious disease mortality marks a third epidemiologic transition characterized by newly emerging, re- emerging, and antibiotic resistant pathogens in the context of an accelerated globalization of human disease ecologies. These transitions illustrate recurring sociohistorical and ecological themes in human\u2013disease relationships from the Paleolithic Age to the present day.",

    "abstract_text": "Prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) occur in approximately 1.5%-2.5% of all primary hip or knee arthroplasties. The mortality rate attributed to PJIs may be as high as 2.5%. Substantial morbidity is associated with a loss of mobility, although this is temporary. The costs associated with a single episode of PJI are approximately $50,000 per episode, exclusive of lost wages. Risk factors that increase the occurrence of PJI include revision arthroplasty, time in the operating room, postoperative surgical site infection, and malignancy. Pain is the most consistent symptom. Staphylococcus species are the most common organisms isolated from PJI sites. Two-stage revision is superior to single-stage revision or to debridement with prosthesis retention. Long-term antibiotic suppression and/or arthrodesis are useful for patients too frail to undergo extensive surgery. Using an optimal approach, recurrent infection occurs in <10% of previously infected joints.",

    "abstract_text": "Since the 1970s, Rubin has promoted a model for causal inference based on the potential outcomes if individuals received each of the treatments under study. Commonly, the assumption is made that the outcome in one individual is independent of the treatment assignment and outcome in other individuals. In infectious diseases, however, whether one person becomes infected is quite often dependent on the infection outcome in other individuals, a situation known as dependent happenings. Here, we review the model proposed by Rubin for the example of infectious disease. Consequences of the violation of the stability assumption include the need for an expanded representation of outcomes, and the existence of different kinds of effects, such as direct and indirect effects. Effects of interest include changes in susceptibility as well as changes in infectiousness. We define the transmission probability formally as an average causal parameter of effect in a population by conditioning on exposure to infection. Unconditional indirect and total effects are difficult to define formally using this model for causal inference. The assignment mechanism can influence the sampling mechanism when it determines who is exposed to infection, raising problems that require further inquiry. We conclude by contrasting the role of differential exposure to infection in direct and indirect effects.",

Manipulation of actin cytoskeleton surrounding Kv2 ER-PM junctions affects their spatial organization. Kv2-containing ER-PM junctions overlap with those formed by canonical ER-PM tethers. ER-PM junction organization by Kv2 channels is unchanged by point mutations that eliminate ion conduction, but abolished by those that eliminate PM clustering without impacting ion channel function. Kv2.2 is distinct in lacking the reversible modulation of junction organization present in Kv2.1.

They are used most commonly for the prevention of measles, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, tetanus, varicella, rabies, and vaccinia. Although their use in the treatment of bacterial infection has largely been supplanted by antibiotics, antibodies remain a critical component of the treatment of diptheria, tetanus, and botulism. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin can be used to treat certain viral infections in immunocompromised patients (e.g., cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, and enterovirus infections). Antibodies may also be of value in toxic shock syndrome, Ebola virus, and refractory staphylococcal infections. Palivizumab, the first monoclonal antibody licensed (in 1998) for an infectious disease, can prevent respiratory syncytial virus infection in high-risk infants. The development and use of additional monoclonal antibodies to key epitopes of microbial pathogens may further define protective humoral responses and lead to new approaches for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.",

Thanks to these data, together with the potential for generic, low-cost manufacturing processes and the completely synthetic nature, the prospects for mRNA vaccines are very promising. In addition, mRNA vaccines have the potential to streamline vaccine discovery and development, and facilitate a rapid response to emerging infectious diseases.

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT Objectives: These guidelines update and extend evidence\u2010based indications for the management of children with acute gastroenteritis in Europe. Methods: The guideline development group formulated questions, identified data, and formulated recommendations. The latter were graded with the Muir Gray system and, in parallel, with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system. Results: Gastroenteritis severity is linked to etiology, and rotavirus is the most severe infectious agent and is frequently associated with dehydration. Dehydration reflects severity and should be monitored by established score systems. Investigations are generally not needed. Oral rehydration with hypoosmolar solution is the major treatment and should start as soon as possible. Breast\u2010feeding should not be interrupted. Regular feeding should continue with no dietary changes including milk. Data suggest that in the hospital setting, in non\u2013breast\u2010fed infants and young children, lactose\u2010free feeds can be considered in the management of gastroenteritis. Active therapy may reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea. Effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as Lactobacillus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii , diosmectite or racecadotril. Anti\u2010infectious drugs should be given in exceptional cases. Ondansetron is effective against vomiting, but its routine use requires safety clearance given the warning about severe cardiac effects. Hospitalization should generally be reserved for children requiring enteral/parenteral rehydration; most cases may be managed in an outpatients setting. Enteral rehydration is superior to intravenous rehydration. Ultrarapid schemes of intravenous rehydration are not superior to standard schemes and may be associated with higher readmission rates. Conclusions: Acute gastroenteritis is best managed using a few simple, well\u2010defined medical interventions.",

Substantial effort has been devoted to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of certain model PFTs. Likewise, specific host pathways mediating survival and immune responses in the face of toxin-mediated cellular damage have been delineated. However, less is known about the overall functions of PFTs during infection in vivo. This review focuses on common themes in the area of PFT biology, with an emphasis on studies addressing the roles of PFTs in in vivo and ex vivo models of colonization or infection. Common functions of PFTs include disruption of epithelial barrier function and evasion of host immune responses, which contribute to bacterial growth and spreading. The widespread nature of PFTs make this group of toxins an attractive target for the development of new virulence-targeted therapies that may have broad activity against human pathogens.",

Understanding pathogens at the population level is as important in disease prevention and control as understanding pathogens at the microscopic or molecular level.

We find that the stability of interactions depends on the intimacy of contact and social context. Casual contact encounters mostly occur in the workplace and are predominantly irregular, while close contact encounters mostly occur at home or in social situations and tend to be more stable. Simulated epidemics of casual contact transmission involve a large number of non-repeated encounters, and the social network is well captured by a random mixing model. However, the stability of the social network should be taken into account for close contact infections.

Residence in and recent travel to these areas are critical elements for the accurate recognition of patients who develop this infection. In this practice guideline, we have organized our recommendations to address actionable questions concerning the entire spectrum of clinical syndromes. These can range from initial pulmonary infection, which eventually resolves whether or not antifungal therapy is administered, to a variety of pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. Additional recommendations address management of coccidioidomycosis occurring for special at-risk populations. Finally, preemptive management strategies are outlined in certain at-risk populations and after unintentional laboratory exposure.",

    "title": "The Economical Control of Infectious Diseases",
    "abstract_text": "The structure of representative agents and decentralisation of the social planner's problem provide a framework for the economics of infection and associated externalities. Optimal implementation of prevention and therapy depends on: (1) biology including whether infection is person to person or by vectors; (2) whether the infected progress to recovery and susceptibility, immunity, or death; (3) costs of interventions; (4) whether interventions target everyone, the uninfected, the infected, or contacts between the two; (5) individual behaviour leading to two types of externalities. By way of example, if people recover to be susceptible, government subsidies should equally favour prevention and therapy. The economic approach to infectious diseases is in its infancy, somewhat oddly because many economists have long had the intuition that epidemics and infectious diseases are quintessential manifestations of the principle of an externality, itself a central concept in economics (Gersovitz and Hammer, forthcoming a). Furthermore, epidemiology provides ready-made dynamic models of disease transmission and economics provides methods of valuing the costs and benefits of health interventions and methods of dynamic optimisation to guide policy. Policy toward infections is of great importance. Yet only recently have economists begun to look at these questions in a formal way. This paper has two main goals. The overarching goal is to dissect two important externalities involving infectious diseases when there are the options of both prevention and therapy, so that the relative phasing of these two types of interventions is important. To achieve this goal, we need to state the social planner's or first-best problem and to compare it to a representative agent's problem. To avoid compounding the identification of any externalities with problems of myopia, imperfect ability to insure health outcomes, or a disregard for the welfare of future generations, we make assumptions about the behaviour of the representative agent such that these problems do not arise, allowing us to focus exclusively on the externalities that we identify. These assumptions may not always be adequate approximations and a relaxation of these assumptions would lead to further considerations in the design of interventions but we do not deal with these issues in this paper. The economic literature on infectious diseases has taken as its starting point some special although important concerns. This starting point has influenced modelling strategies in ways that we believe obscures the general structure of private choice and consequent externalities in the process of disease transmission.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a powerful innovative gene amplification technique emerging as a simple rapid diagnostic tool for early detection and identification of microbial diseases. The whole procedure is very simple and rapid wherein the amplification can be completed in less than 1 h under isothermal conditions employing a set of six specially designed primers spanning eight distinct sequences of a target gene, by incubating all the reagents in a single tube. Gene amplification products can be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis as well as by real\u2010time monitoring in an inexpensive turbidimeter. Gene copy number can also be quantified with the help of a standard curve generated from different concentrations of gene copy number plotted against time of positivity with the help of a real\u2010time turbidimeter. Alternatively, gene amplification can be visualised by the naked eye either as turbidity or in the form of a colour change when SYBR Green I, a fluorescent dsDNA intercalating dye, is employed. LAMP does not require a thermal cycler and can be performed simply with a heating block and/or water bath. Considering the advantages of rapid amplification, simple operation and easy detection, LAMP has potential applications for clinical diagnosis as well as surveillance of infectious diseases in developing countries without requiring sophisticated equipment or skilled personnel.

The prevalence of confirmed-positive test results for HBsAg, HCV, HIV, and HTLV were evaluated for each year for first-time donors from 1995 through 2001. Incidence rates for these infections were evaluated among repeat donors having at least two donations in a 2-year period. The frequencies of HIV-1 RNA- and HCV RNA-positive, seronegative donations were assessed for first-time and repeat donations. The relationship risk = (window period) x (incidence) was used to assess residual risk among repeat donations and to evaluate the incidence of HCV and HIV infection among first-time donors.During the study period, prevalence rates for all markers declined significantly over time: in 2001, the rates per 100,000 were 75.6 for HBsAg, 299 for HCV, 9.7 for HIV, and 9.6 for HTLV; the corresponding incidence rates (/100,000 person-years) were 1.267, 1.889, 1.554, and 0.239, respectively. Estimates of residual risk in donations from repeat donors (after NAT) for HCV and HIV were 1 per 1,935,000 and 1 per 2,135,000, respectively. However, incidence rates for these agents are approximately two times greater among first-time donors. For both HCV and HIV, NAT yield was concordant with that predicted by current window-period models.These data cover about half of all the whole blood collected in the United States. They suggest increasing improvement in transfusion safety and clearly define the benefit of pooled NAT.",

This updated guideline from the American Society of Transplantation Infectious Diseases Community of Practice provides evidence\u2010based and expert recommendations for screening, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of CMV in solid organ transplant recipients. CMV serology to detect immunoglobulin G remains as the standard method for pretransplant screening of donors and transplant candidates. Antiviral prophylaxis and preemptive therapy are the mainstays of CMV prevention. The lack of a widely applicable viral load threshold for diagnosis and preemptive therapy is highlighted, as a result of variability of CMV nucleic acid testing, even in the contemporary era when calibrators are standardized. Valganciclovir and intravenous ganciclovir remain as drugs of choice for CMV management. Strategies for managing drug\u2010resistant CMV infection are presented. There is an increasing use of CMV\u2010specific cell\u2010mediated immune assays to stratify the risk of CMV infection after solid organ transplantation, but their role in optimizing CMV prevention and treatment efforts has yet to be demonstrated.

    "abstract_text": "Infectious diseases of poverty (IDoP) disproportionately affect the poorest population in the world and contribute to a cycle of poverty as a result of decreased productivity ensuing from long-term illness, disability, and social stigma. In 2010, the global deaths from HIV/AIDS have increased to 1.5 million and malaria mortality rose to 1.17 million. Mortality from neglected tropical diseases rose to 152,000, while tuberculosis killed 1.2 million people that same year. Substantial regional variations exist in the distribution of these diseases as they are primarily concentrated in rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, with geographic overlap and high levels of co-infection. Evidence-based interventions exist to prevent and control these diseases, however, the coverage still remains low with an emerging challenge of antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, community-based delivery platforms are increasingly being advocated to ensure sustainability and combat co-infections. Because of the high morbidity and mortality burden of these diseases, especially in resource-poor settings, it is imperative to conduct a systematic review to identify strategies to prevent and control these diseases. Therefore, we attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of one of these strategies, that is community-based delivery for the prevention and treatment of IDoP. In this paper, we describe the burden, epidemiology, and potential interventions for IDoP. In subsequent papers of this series, we describe the analytical framework and the methodology used to guide the systematic reviews, and report the findings and interpretations of our analyses of the impact of community-based strategies on individual IDoPs.",

Network modelling is a flexible tool used to capture the heterogeneous contacts of a population in order to test hypotheses about the mechanisms of disease transmission, simulate and predict disease spread, and test disease control strategies. This review highlights how to use animal contact data, including social networks, for network modelling, and emphasizes that researchers should have a pathogen of interest in mind before collecting or using contact data. This paper describes the rising popularity of network approaches for understanding transmission dynamics in wild animal and livestock populations; discusses the common mismatch between contact networks as measured in animal behaviour and relevant parasites to match those networks; and highlights knowledge gaps in how to collect and analyse contact data. Opportunities for the future include increased attention to experiments, pathogen genetic markers and novel computational tools.",

Virus phylogenies have been used in many recent studies to infer properties of epidemics. These approaches rely on coalescent models that may not be appropriate for infectious diseases. We account for phylogenetic patterns of viruses in susceptible\u2013infected (SI), susceptible\u2013infected\u2013susceptible (SIS), and susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (SIR) models of infectious disease, and our approach may be a viable alternative to demographic models used to reconstruct epidemic dynamics. The method allows epidemiological parameters, such as the reproductive number, to be estimated directly from viral sequence data. We also describe patterns of phylogenetic clustering that are often construed as arising from a short chain of transmissions. Our model reproduces the moments of the distribution of phylogenetic cluster sizes and may therefore serve as a null hypothesis for cluster sizes under simple epidemiological models. We examine a small cross-sectional sample of human immunodeficiency (HIV)-1 sequences collected in the United States and compare our results to standard estimates of effective population size. Estimated prevalence is consistent with estimates of effective population size and the known history of the HIV epidemic. While our model accurately estimates prevalence during exponential growth, we find that periods of decline are harder to identify.",

    "abstract_text": "Running over timescales that span decades or centuries, the epidemiological transition provides the central narrative of global health. In this transition, a reduction in mortality is followed by a reduction in fertility, creating larger, older populations in which the main causes of illness and death are no longer acute infections of children but chronic diseases of adults. Since the year 2000, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have provided a framework for accelerating the decline of infectious diseases, backed by a massive injection of foreign investment to low-income countries. Despite the successes of the MDGs era, the inhabitants of low-income countries still suffer an enormous burden of disease owing to diarrhoea, pneumonia, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other pathogens. Adding to the predictable burden of endemic disease, the threat of pandemics is ever-present and global. With a view to the future, this review spotlights five aspects of the fight against infection beyond 2015, when the MDGs will be replaced by a new set of goals for poverty reduction and sustainable development. These aspects are: exploiting the biological links between infectious and non-infectious diseases; controlling infections among the new urban majority; enhancing the response to international health threats; expanding childhood immunization programmes to prevent acute and chronic diseases in adults; and working towards universal health coverage. By scanning the wider horizon now, infectious disease specialists have the chance to shape the post-2015 era of health and development.",

    "abstract_text": "During the processes of human population dispersal around the world over the past 50 000\u2013100 000 years, along with associated cultural evolution and inter\u2013population contact and conflict, there have been several major transitions in the relationships of Homo sapiens with the natural world, animate and inanimate. Each of these transitions has resulted in the emergence of new or unfamiliar infectious diseases. The three great historical transitions since the initial advent of agriculture and livestock herding, from ca . 10 000 years ago, occurred when: (i) early agrarian\u2013based settlements enabled sylvatic enzootic microbes to make contact with Homo sapiens ; (ii) early Eurasian civilizations (such as the Greek and Roman empires, China and south Asia) came into military and commercial contact, ca . 3000\u20132000 years ago, swapping their dominant infections; and (iii) European expansionism, over the past five centuries, caused the transoceanic spread of often lethal infectious diseases. This latter transition is best known in relation to the conquest of the Americas by Spanish conquistadores , when the inadvertent spread of measles, smallpox and influenza devastated the Amerindian populations. Today, we are living through the fourth of these great transitional periods. The contemporary spread and increased lability of various infectious diseases, new and old, reflect the combined and increasingly widespread impacts of demographic, environmental, behavioural, technological and other rapid changes in human ecology. Modern clinical medicine has, via blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and the use of hypodermic syringes, created new opportunities for microbes. These have contributed to the rising iatrogenic problems of hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS and several other viral infections. Meanwhile, the injudicious use of antibiotics has been a rare instance of human action actually increasing \u2018biodiversity\u2019. Another aspect of this fourth transition is that modern hyper\u2013hygienic living restricts microbial exposure in early life. This, in the 1950s, may have contributed to an epidemic of more serious, disabling, poliomyelitis, affecting older children than those affected in earlier, more endemic decades. As with previous human\u2013microbe transitions, a new equilibrial state may lie ahead. However, it certainly will not entail a world free of infectious diseases. Any mature, sustainable, human ecology must come to terms with both the need for, and the needs of, the microbial species that help to make up the interdependent system of life on Earth. Humans and microbes are not \u2018at war\u2019; rather, both parties are engaged in amoral, self\u2013interested, coevolutionary struggle. We need to understand better, and therefore anticipate, the dynamics of that process.",

    "abstract_text": "There is an increasing scientific and commercial interest in the use of beneficial microorganisms, or \u201cprobiotics,\u201d for the prevention and treatment of disease. The microorganisms most frequently used as probiotic agents are lactic-acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), which has been extensively studied in recent literature. Multiple mechanisms of action have been postulated, including lactose digestion, production of antimicrobial agents, competition for space or nutrients, and immunomodulation. We have reviewed recent studies of probiotics for the treatment and control of infectious diseases. Studies of pediatric diarrhea show substantial evidence of clinical benefits from probiotic therapy in patients with viral gastroenteritis, and data on LGG treatment for Clostridium difficile diarrhea appear promising. However, data to support use of probiotics for prevention of traveler's diarrhea are more limited. New research suggests potential applications in vaccine development and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. Further studies are needed to take full advantage of this traditional medical approach and to apply it to the infectious diseases of the new millennium.",

    "abstract_text": "Infectious diseases are acknowledged as one of the most critical threats to global public health today. Climate change, unprecedented population growth with accelerated rates of antimicrobial resistance, have resulted in both the emergence of novel pathogenic organisms and the re-emergence of infections that were once controlled. The consequences have led to an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases globally. The ability to rapidly monitor the spread of diseases is key for prevention, intervention and control, however several limitations exist for current surveillance systems and the capacity to cope with the rapid population growth and environmental changes. Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) is a new epidemiology tool that has potential to act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. WBE postulates that through the analysis of population pooled wastewater, infectious disease and resistance spread, the emergence of new disease outbreak to the community level can be monitored comprehensively and in real-time. This manuscript provides critical overview of current infectious disease surveillance status, as well as it introduces WBE and its recent advancements. It also provides recommendations for further development required for WBE application as an effective tool for infectious disease surveillance.",

Since then newer tests for diagnosing CDI have become available, especially nucleic acid amplification tests. The main objectives of this update of the guidance document are to summarize the currently available evidence concerning laboratory diagnosis of CDI and to formulate and revise recommendations to optimize CDI testing. This update is essential to improve the diagnosis of CDI and to improve uniformity in CDI diagnosis for surveillance purposes among Europe. An electronic search for literature concerning the laboratory diagnosis of CDI was performed. Studies evaluating a commercial laboratory test compared to a reference test were also included in a meta-analysis. The commercial tests that were evaluated included enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) detecting glutamate dehydrogenase, EIAs detecting toxins A and B and nucleic acid amplification tests. Recommendations were formulated by an executive committee, and the strength of recommendations and quality of evidence were graded using the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. No single commercial test can be used as a stand-alone test for diagnosing CDI as a result of inadequate positive predictive values at low CDI prevalence. Therefore, the use of a two-step algorithm is recommended. Samples without free toxin detected by toxins A and B EIA but with positive glutamate dehydrogenase EIA, nucleic acid amplification test or toxigenic culture results need clinical evaluation to discern CDI from asymptomatic carriage.",

    "abstract_text": "The human population is growing, requiring more space for food production, and needing more animals to feed it. Emerging infectious diseases are increasing, causing losses in both human and animal lives, as well as large costs to society. Many factors are contributing to disease emergence, including climate change, globalization and urbanization, and most of these factors are to some extent caused by humans. Pathogens may be more or less prone to emergence in themselves, and rapidly mutating viruses are more common among the emerging pathogens. The climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases are likely to be emerging due to climate changes and environmental changes, such as increased irrigation. This review lists the factors within pathogens that make them prone to emergence, and the modes of transmission that are affected. The anthropogenic changes contributing to disease emergence are described, as well as how they directly and indirectly cause either increased numbers of susceptible or exposed individuals, or cause increased infectivity. Many actions may have multiple direct or indirect effects, and it may be difficult to assess what the consequences may be. In addition, most anthropogenic drivers are related to desired activities, such as logging, irrigation, trade, and travelling, which the society is requiring. It is important to research more about the indirect and direct effects of the different actions to understand both the benefits and the risks.",

Similarly, thyroiditis occurring with syphilis was often equated with treponemal invasion of the gland. Acute bacterial thyroiditis is rapid in onset and more likely than tuberculous infection to produce fever, pain, and tenderness. Suppurative and mycobacterial infections are most common among women with preexisting thyroid disorders. Mortality due to infectious thyroiditis is lower in cases covered by this review than has been previously reported. Gummatous and fungal infections of the thyroid are generally diagnosed only at biopsy or necropsy. Frequent thyroidal involvement in disseminated aspergillosis warrants careful investigation of the gland in patients with this infection.

We provide a systematic analysis of generic dynamical features of the model on regular and complex metapopulation network topologies and show that significant dynamical differences exist to ordinary reaction-diffusion and effective force of infection models. On a lattice we calculate an expression for the velocity of the propagating epidemic front and find that, in contrast to the diffusive systems, our model predicts a saturation of the velocity with an increasing traveling rate. Furthermore, we show that a fully stochastic system exhibits a novel threshold for the attack ratio of an outbreak that is absent in diffusion and force of infection models. These insights not only capture natural features of human mobility relevant for the geographical epidemic spread, they may serve as a starting point for modeling important dynamical processes in human and animal epidemiology, population ecology, biology, and evolution.Received 13 October 2010DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.1.011001This article is available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.

Methods We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of all COVID\u20102019 cases in the only referral hospital in Shenzhen City, China, from January 11, 2020, to February 6, 2020, and followed until March 6, 2020. Results Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233 (81.5%) had been to Hubei, while 42 (14%) did not have a clear travel history. Only 218 (73.15%) cases had a fever as the initial symptom. Compared with the nonsevere cases, severe cases were associated with older age, those with underlying diseases, and higher levels of C\u2010reactive protein, interleukin\u20106, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Slower clearance of the virus was associated with a higher risk of progression to critical condition. As of March 6, 2020, 268 (89.9%) patients were discharged and the overall case fatality ratio was 1.0%. Conclusions In a designated hospital outside Hubei Province, COVID\u20102019 patients could be effectively managed by properly using the existing hospital system. Mortality may be lowered when cases are relatively mild, and there are sufficient medical resources to care and treat the disease.",

    "title": "Bacterial lectins, cell\u2010cell recognition and infectious disease",
    "abstract_text": "Numerous bacterial strains produce surface lectins, commonly in the form of fimbriae that are filamentous assemblies of protein subunits. Among the best characterized of these are the type 1 (mannose specific) fimbrial lectins of Escherichia coli that consist almost exclusively of one class of subunit with a molecular mass of 17 kDa. They possess an extended combining site corresponding to a trisaccharide and preferentially bind carbohydrate units of oligomannose or hybrid type. Type 1 fimbriae also possess a hydrophobic region close to the carbohydrate\u2010binding site, since aromatic \u03b1\u2010mannosides inhibit strongly (up to 1000\u2010times more than methyl \u03b1\u2010mannoside) the agglutination of yeasts by the bacteria and the adherence of the latter to pig ileal epithelial cells. The combining sites of type 1 fimbriae of the salmonellae and of other enteric bacteria are different from those of E. coli in that they are smaller and do not possess a hydrophobic region. The various bacterial surface lectins appear to function primarily in the initiation of infection by mediating bacterial adherence to epithelial cells, e.g. in the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts. The mannose specific lectins also act as recognition molecules in lectinophagocytosis (i.e. phagocytosis of the bacteria in the absence of opsonins) by mouse, rat and human peritoneal macrophages, and human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Affinity chromatography of membrane lysates from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes on immobilized type 1 fimbrial lectin, using methyl \u03b1\u2010mannoside as eluent, showed that glycoproteins with apparent molecular masses of 70\u201380, 100 and 150 kDa act as receptors for the bacteria. Inhibition experiments with monoclonal antibodies suggest that the glycoprotein bands of 100 and 150 kDa may be identical with the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits of leukocyte complement receptors and adhesion glycoproteins involved in complement\u2010mediated opsonophagocytosis. The systems described serve as a fine illustration for the biological role of lectin\u2010carbohydrate interactions. Further studies of these systems will lead to a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of infectious diseases, and perhaps also to new approaches for their prevention.",

Inhibition of Th2 cell-mediated, humoral or mucosal immunity is associated with HS. HS is more frequently seen in HTLV-1 than HIV patients. In AIDS, there is an increase in Th2 cytokines, while in HTLV-1 infection there is a decrease in the Th2 response, leading to an increased risk of autoinfection. Corticosteroid use remains the most frequent risk factor for HS. A number of ELISAs are useful for diagnosis and post-treatment evaluation. Once diagnosed, the disease may be managed effectively with anthelminthic drugs, including ivermectin.

A systematic review was conducted to enumerate cartographic progress, with respect to the data available for mapping and the methods currently applied. The results helped define the minimum information requirements for mapping infectious disease occurrence, and a quantitative framework for assessing the mapping opportunities for all infectious diseases. This revealed that of 355 infectious diseases identified, 174 (49%) have a strong rationale for mapping and of these only 7 (4%) had been comprehensively mapped. A variety of ambitions, such as the quantification of the global burden of infectious disease, international biosurveillance, assessing the likelihood of infectious disease outbreaks and exploring the propensity for infectious disease evolution and emergence, are limited by these omissions. An overview of the factors hindering progress in disease cartography is provided. It is argued that rapid improvement in the landscape of infectious diseases mapping can be made by embracing non-conventional data sources, automation of geo-positioning and mapping procedures enabled by machine learning and information technology, respectively, in addition to harnessing labour of the volunteer \u2018cognitive surplus\u2019 through crowdsourcing.",

    "abstract_text": "Men may not be able to multitask, but it is emerging that proteins can. This capacity of proteins to exhibit more than one function is termed protein moonlighting, and, surprisingly, many highly conserved proteins involved in metabolic regulation or the cell stress response have a range of additional biological actions which are involved in bacterial virulence. This review highlights the multiple roles exhibited by a range of bacterial proteins, such as glycolytic and other metabolic enzymes and molecular chaperones, and the role that such moonlighting activity plays in the virulence characteristics of a number of important human pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",

    "title": "The X chromosome and sex-specific effects in infectious disease susceptibility",
    "abstract_text": "The X chromosome and X-linked variants have largely been ignored in genome-wide and candidate association studies of infectious diseases due to the complexity of statistical analysis of the X chromosome. This exclusion is significant, since the X chromosome contains a high density of immune-related genes and regulatory elements that are extensively involved in both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Many diseases present with a clear sex bias, and apart from the influence of sex hormones and socioeconomic and behavioural factors, the X chromosome, X-linked genes and X chromosome inactivation mechanisms contribute to this difference. Females are functional mosaics for X-linked genes due to X chromosome inactivation and this, combined with other X chromosome inactivation mechanisms such as genes that escape silencing and skewed inactivation, could contribute to an immunological advantage for females in many infections. In this review, we discuss the involvement of the X chromosome and X inactivation in immunity and address its role in sexual dimorphism of infectious diseases using tuberculosis susceptibility as an example, in which male sex bias is clear, yet not fully explored.",

    "title": "Hepatitis C Guidance 2019 Update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases\u2013Infectious Diseases Society of America Recommendations for Testing, Managing, and Treating Hepatitis C Virus Infection",
    "abstract_text": "The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) initiated the hepatitis C virus (HCV) guidance project (hereafter HCV guidance) in 2013. The AASLD-IDSA HCV guidance website (www.HCVGuidelines.org) disseminates up-to-date, peer-reviewed, unbiased, evidence-based recommendations to aid clinicians making decisions regarding the testing, management, and treatment of HCV infection. Using a web-based system enables timely and nimble distribution of the HCV guidance, which is periodically updated in near real time as necessitated by emerging research data, recommendations from public health agencies, the availability of therapeutic agents, or other significant developments affecting the rapidly evolving hepatitis C arena. The value and utility of the online HCV guidance to the community of hepatitis C care providers throughout the world is evidence by the nearly 10 million pageviews by 1.5 million users originating from 228 countries and territories since the January 2014 launch of the website. A major update of the HCV guidance was released electronically in November 2019. This HCV guidance update summarizes and highlights key new or amended recommendations since the previous October 2018 print publication.1 The advent of safe, well-tolerated, and highly efficacious (>95% cure rate)2 direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for HCV infection has ushered in an era in which elimination of hepatitis C is conceivable. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a global health sector strategy to eliminate hepatitis C as a public health threat by 2030 and developed an action plan to facilitate this goal.3 In response to the WHO action plan, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) developed a US strategy for the elimination of hepatitis C.4 Key elements of the elimination plan include improved detection of undiagnosed cases, increased linkage and access to care for newly diagnosed persons, and expanded treatment access. Many of the recommendations included in the latest update to the HCV guidance and highlighted herein align with and support the goals of the NASEM and WHO strategies to move from control to eventual elimination of hepatitis C. Topics addressed include universal and risk-based hepatitis C screening, simplified treatment algorithms for treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, hepatitis C management in the pediatric population, acute hepatitis C testing and management, and transplantation of organs from HCV-viremic donors into HCV-negative recipients. For detailed evidence reviews related to these topics and information addressing other aspects of HCV testing and management, see the online HCV guidance (www.HCVGuidelines.org). The HCV guidance was developed and is updated by a volunteer panel (representing the AASLD and the IDSA) of hepatology and infectious diseases clinicians with hepatitis C expertise using an evidence-based review of available data, including information presented at scientific conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. Based on scientific evidence and expert opinion, recommendations are rated by the level of evidence (I, II, or III) and the strength of the recommendation (A, B, or C) using a system adapted from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association.5, 6 See the original AASLD\u2013IDSA hepatitis C guidance publication7 or the HCV guidance website for additional details about the processes and methods employed. All recommendations are reviewed and approved by the governing boards of the AASLD and the IDSA. The HCV guidance panel classifies therapeutic regimens as recommended, alternative, or not recommended based on patient factors (i.e., treatment-naive versus experienced, cirrhosis status, and comorbidities) and viral characteristics (i.e., genotype, subtype, resistance-associated substitutions). Recommended regimens are considered equivalent; alternative regimens are effective but, compared to recommended regimens, have potential disadvantages, limitations for use in certain patient populations, or less supporting data. The identification of risk factors associated with contracting HCV infection served as the basis for the risk-based hepatitis C screening recommendations issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1998.8 Although sensitive for the identification of persons with chronic HCV infection, risk-based screening failed to identify the majority of individuals with HCV infection due to both clinician and patient barriers.9-12 Analysis of the 2003-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey prevalence data demonstrated that approximately three fourths of individuals with chronic hepatitis C in the United States belonged to the 1945-1965 birth cohort.13 Based on these data, both the CDC and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended one-time hepatitis C screening of all individuals in this birth cohort (1945-1965) regardless of risk factors.14, 15 Since these recommendations were established in 2012, HCV epidemiology in the United States has changed. Hepatitis C infection incidence nearly quadrupled from 2010 to 2017, primarily driven by increased injection drug use related to the opioid epidemic.16-19 CDC viral hepatitis surveillance data indicate progressively increasing acute HCV infection incidence each year from 2009 through 2017. Most of these new HCV infections occurred in persons born after 1965, with those aged 20-39 years accounting for the majority of cases. This ongoing trend has spurred interest in expanding HCV screening among the general US population. Several modeling studies suggest the cost-effectiveness of such an approach.20-23 Accordingly, the AASLD\u2013IDSA guidance HCV screening and follow-up recommendations have been updated and include recommended universal HCV screening for all adults aged 18 years or older followed by periodic testing for persons with ongoing risk behaviors and/or exposures. In light of the inadequacy of targeted HCV case finding using risk-based and birth cohort HCV screening,24, 25 investigators have modeled the cost-effectiveness of one-time universal HCV screening for adults aged \u2265 18 years. Independent studies using different modeling techniques demonstrate that one-time universal screening for adults aged \u2265 18 years is cost-effective (<$30,000/quality-adjusted life-years) compared with birth-cohort screening.20, 26 Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of nontargeted HCV screening has proven robust in a variety of venues including correctional,27 prenatal,28, 29 and primary care30 settings as well as substance use treatment centers.31, 32 Given the current epidemiology of HCV disease in the United States, the cost-effectiveness of universal HCV screening, the high efficacy of DAA therapy, and the myriad liver-related and other health benefits of virologic cure,33-38 the HCV guidance panel recommends universal, one-time, opt-out HCV screening of adults aged \u2265 18 years. Although neither the CDC nor the USPSTF currently recommend universal HCV screening in adults, the CDC initiated a peer review process to consider such a recommendation in July 2019. Similarly, in August 2019, the USPSTF published a draft recommendation for universal HCV screening among adults aged 18-79 years. The USPSTF draft universal hepatitis C screening recommendation differs from that of the AASLD\u2013IDSA HCV guidance by setting an upper age limit of 79 years. The HCV guidance panel does not recommend an age limit for universal adult HCV screening due to the excellent quality of life of many octogenarians and the association between advanced age and more rapid HCV disease progression. The HCV guidance panel's new universal screening recommendation is intended to enhance HCV case finding among adults not included in the 1945-1965 birth cohort and aligns with the WHO and NASEM goals of eliminating HCV as a public health threat by 2030. This is particularly important for men and women aged 20-39 years due to the disproportionate overlapping impact of the opioid epidemic and associated injection drug use and the rising rate of incident HCV infections in this age group. Universal HCV screening also bypasses the inherent barriers in ascertaining an accurate risk factor assessment. One-time, risk-based HCV screening is recommended for persons younger than 18 years old with current or past behaviors, exposures, or conditions or circumstances associated with an increased risk of HCV infection (see Table 1). There is currently insufficient evidence to support universal HCV screening in the pediatric population. People with an ongoing risk factor(s) for HCV infection remain vulnerable for as long as the behavior, exposure, condition, or circumstance persists, thereby warranting periodic repeat HCV testing. There is a paucity of data addressing the optimal frequency of repeat testing, thereby leaving the periodicity to the clinician's discretion on a case-by-case basis with consideration of an individual's risk for HCV infection or reinfection. People who inject drugs (PWID) and men with HIV infection who have unprotected sex with men are exceptions to this guidance. Because of the high incidence and prevalence of HCV infection in these populations,39-47 at least annual HCV testing is recommended. Given that many PWID lack access to or eschew traditional health care\u2013delivery systems, integration of HCV testing services into substance use treatment programs, needle/syringe service programs, and acute detoxification programs expands the opportunities to accomplish periodic HCV testing in this key population.48-50 HCV-antibody testing using a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2013approved assay (laboratory-based or point-of-care) is recommended for initial HCV screening.51, 52 The sensitivity and specificity of the lone FDA-approved point-of-care test (OraQuick HCV Rapid Antibody Test; OraSure Technologies Inc., Bethlehem, PA) are similar to laboratory-based assays.53, 54 A positive HCV-antibody test indicates current (active) HCV infection (acute or chronic), a past resolved infection, or rarely a false-positive result.55 A test to detect HCV viremia is necessary to confirm active HCV infection (see Fig. 1). Ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing. This approach requires a single blood collection and avoids a return visit for confirmatory testing, a major barrier in the continuum of care.56 Collection of dried blood spots is an option for sequential HCV-antibody and reflex HCV-RNA testing. Dried blood spot collection can be accomplished with a fingerstick rather than venepuncture, and transport does not require an intact cold chain, making this an advantageous testing option in rural areas and among people for whom phlebotomy is a testing barrier.57 An FDA-approved quantitative or qualitative HCV-RNA assay with a detection level of \u226425 IU/mL should be used. HCV-RNA testing is required to detect reinfection after previous spontaneous or treatment-related viral clearance because HCV-antibody positivity is expected (see Fig. 1). Immunocompromised persons and those with possible HCV exposure in the prior 6 months may be HCV antibody\u2013negative due to delayed or failed seroconversion58 or being in the seroconversion window period,52 respectively. HCV-RNA testing is a consideration for these individuals, particularly for those with a known risk factor(s). Persons who have a reactive HCV-antibody test and a negative (not detected) HCV-RNA test should be informed that they do not have evidence of current HCV infection. Although additional testing is typically unnecessary, HCV-RNA testing can be repeated for persons with ongoing HCV infection risk or if there is a high index of suspicion for recent infection. If either the clinician or the patient wishes to determine whether a positive HCV-antibody test in the absence of HCV viremia represents a resolved HCV infection or a biologic false positive, repeat testing with a different HCV-antibody assay can be undertaken. A false positive typically does not occur with two different assays.51, 59 Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiating antiviral therapy to determine baseline viremia (viral load), which may affect treatment duration with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir therapy. With the advent of pangenotypic DAA regimens, HCV genotyping is no longer universally required prior to treatment initiation. Pretreatment genotyping is recommended for persons with a prior HCV treatment failure because DAA regimen selection and duration may differ by genotype. Pretreatment genotyping is not required for treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis if a pangenotypic regimen is used. Upon diagnosis of active HCV infection, patients require counseling and certain clinical interventions prior to initiation of antiviral therapy. Prevention of further liver damage is crucial. To that end, counseling patients to abstain from alcohol takes priority because of associations between excess alcohol use and incident or progressive fibrosis and the development of HCC.60-69 There is no known safe level of alcohol use for patients with chronic hepatitis C. All patients with chronic hepatitis C, especially those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, should be advised to abstain from alcohol use.70-72 Persons suffering from alcohol use disorder require treatment for this condition; consider referring these individuals to an addiction specialist. Ongoing alcohol use, however, is not a contraindication to antiviral therapy. Data indicate that ongoing alcohol use does not affect therapeutic outcomes with DAA regimens among treatment-adherent patients.73 From a public health perspective, educating persons with HCV infection about how to avoid transmitting the virus to others (Table 2) serves as an essential primary prevention measure to curb and eventually eliminate the hepatitis C epidemic. Exposure to infected blood is the primary mode of HCV transmission. Epidemics of acute HCV due to sexual transmission in men with HIV infection who have sex with men have also been described.74-77 Persons should be counseled to stop using illicit drugs and enter substance abuse treatment. Those who continue to inject drugs should be counseled to: Assessing liver disease severity is an essential component of the workup for all persons with newly diagnosed chronic hepatitis C as this factor influences initial and follow-up evaluation. This assessment (i.e., presence or absence of cirrhosis) can usually be accomplished with noninvasive tests (Table 3). Liver biopsy is rarely required but is a consideration if other causes of liver disease are suspected. Persons with known or suspected cirrhosis are at increased risk for complications of advanced liver disease and require frequent follow-up. They should also avoid hepatotoxic drugs, such as excessive acetaminophen (>2 g/day) and certain herbal supplements. Nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) should also be avoided. Ongoing imaging surveillance for HCC and gastroesophageal varices is recommended for patients with cirrhosis.78-80 Cirrhosis with portal hypertension portends a greater likelihood of developing future hepatic complications in untreated patients.81, 82 Transient elastography provides point-of-care information regarding liver stiffness and can reliably distinguish patients with a high versus low likelihood of cirrhosis.83-85 Screening for HBV with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and HIV with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended because these coinfections are associated with a poorer HCV prognosis.86-90 Persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk.91 Anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed.92 Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed. The CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.93 Chronic HCV infection is an important infectious cause of death in the United States and a major contributor to morbidity and mortality from viral hepatitis globally. The availability of safe, effective, well-tolerated therapy substantially facilitates the goal of expanding HCV treatment as recommended in the HCV elimination strategies of the WHO3 and the NASEM.4 Overall, DAA regimens successfully cure HCV infection in > 95% of treated persons.2 Moreover, the development of coformulated, pangenotypic regimens that require relatively short treatment durations has greatly simplified HCV antiviral therapy administration. Despite these remarkable therapeutic improvements, in 2015, only 7.4% of persons with diagnosed HCV had begun antiviral treatment.94 Although more recent limited data indicate increased DAA access and uptake, this has been uneven geographically and across different patient populations.95-97 Thus, only a minority of persons with HCV infection obtain the many health benefits of successful treatment. From a public health perspective, successful HCV treatment also supports primary prevention by decreasing the population of persons capable of transmitting the virus, thereby reducing the incidence of HCV infection. Eradicating hepatitis C infection results in numerous health benefits, including reduced rates of all-cause mortality, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and HCC.33, 37, 98-110 Successful treatment also confers improvement in extrahepatic manifestations of HCV disease, including cryoglobulinemic vasculitis111-116 and HCV-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other lymphoproliferative disorders,117-125 as well as improved productivity and quality of life.34, 35, 126-131 Given these and other benefits associated with virologic cure, the HCV guidance panel strongly recommends antiviral treatment for all adults with acute or chronic HCV infection (except those with a short life expectancy that cannot be remediated). Importantly, this recommendation includes persons with ongoing substance use (alcohol or drugs). Several studies demonstrate that treatment-committed individuals in this disproportionately affected population achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) rates with DAA therapy comparable to those without known, current substance use.73, 132-139 The universal treatment recommendation represents a principal tenet of the HCV guidance along with newly recommended universal hepatitis C screening of adults. The HCV guidance panel urges health care providers caring for adults to encourage hepatitis C screening and treatment (if positive) because DAA therapy is safe and cures HCV infection in most people.2 One approach to improving access to curative HCV treatment is expanding the number of health care providers administering antiviral therapy. Data demonstrate that HCV treatment can be effectively provided by a broad range of health care professionals with differing expertise\u2014including specialists, primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, clinical pharmacy specialists, physician assistants, and registered nurses\u2014without compromising treatment efficacy or safety.95, 140 Consequently, the HCV guidance panel developed simplified HCV treatment algorithms for treatment-naive adults (without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis), which align with the NASEM plan to eliminate HCV as a US public health burden by 2030. These simplified treatment algorithms are designed to be used by any health care provider knowledgeable about HCV disease and treatment, including those without extensive experience who have timely access to a specialist. The simplified treatment algorithms provide concise, clear guidance on pretreatment assessment, on-treatment monitoring, assessment of response, and posttreatment management (see Figs. 2 and 3). The simplified HCV treatment algorithm for adults without cirrhosis (see Fig. 2) applies to persons aged \u2265 18 years who have not been previously treated for their infection and do not have evidence of cirrhosis as defined by the noninvasive parameters specified in the HCV guidance. Evidence of cirrhosis includes a FIB-4 score > 3.25 or any of the following findings from a previously performed test: transient elastography indicating cirrhosis (e.g., FibroScan [Echosens, Paris, France] stiffness > 12.5 kPa), noninvasive serologic tests that exceed proprietary cutoffs (e.g., FibroSure [BioPredictive, Paris, France], Enhanced Liver Fibrosis Test [Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany], etc.), clinical evidence of cirrhosis (e.g., liver nodularity and/or splenomegaly on imaging, platelet count < 150,000/mm3, etc.), and/or prior liver biopsy showing cirrhosis. This simplified treatment algorithm is not recommended for persons with HIV and/or HBV infection, prior liver transplantation, HCC, end-stage renal disease (i.e., estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/m2), and/or current pregnancy because they require more nuanced care. See the online HCV guidance for management and treatment recommendations for these patients. The pretreatment evaluation should include an assessment for cirrhosis, medication reconciliation, drug\u2013drug interactions, and patient education regarding treatment administration and the importance of adherence and transmission prevention. Recommended pretreatment laboratory testing is conducted to confirm chronic HCV infection and exclude decompensated liver disease, HBV and/or HIV coinfection, end-stage renal disease, and pregnancy prior to treatment initiation. Clearance of HCV infection with DAA therapy can improve hepatic function and thereby affect the safety and efficacy of some concomitantly administered medications. Real-world data indicate an association between DAA therapy and reduced glycemia, particularly among people with diabetes.141-144 Patients taking diabetes medication(s) should be informed of the potential for symptomatic hypoglycemia during and after DAA therapy. Glucose monitoring during and after DAA treatment is recommended; dosage adjustments of diabetes medication(s) may be needed. Real-world data also indicate an association between DAA therapy and a clinically significant reduction in warfarin dose response.145, 146 Patients taking warfarin should be informed of the potential for a change in their anticoagulation status. International normalized ratio (INR) monitoring for subtherapeutic anticoagulation is recommended during and after DAA treatment; warfarin dosage adjustments may be needed. For others, on-treatment laboratory monitoring is not required unless a patient experiences treatment-related side effects or there are adherence concerns. Several well-designed, robust clinical trials have demonstrated the safety147 and high curative efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir148-158 and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir159-164 among treatment-naive persons without cirrhosis regardless of HCV genotype. These findings have been confirmed in real-world cohort studies for both glecaprevir/pibrentasvir165-167 and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.167-171 Based on these data, 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is recommended for adults eligible for the simplified treatment algorithm. To assess treatment response, HCV-RNA and hepatic aminotransferase testing is recommended 12 or more weeks after completing DAA treatment. Undetectable HCV RNA represents SVR and virologic cure. In the absence of cirrhosis, persons who attain SVR require no liver-specific follow-up. For those with ongoing HCV risk factors, risk-reduction counseling is recommended as well as HCV-RNA testing annually or anytime an increase in hepatic aminotransferase levels occurs. Recurrent HCV viremia after attainment of SVR represents either reinfection or a relapse (i.e., reemergence of the originally infecting HCV strain).172, 173 With reinfection, treatment approaches are identical to those for initial treatment. If relapse is suspected or cannot be ruled out, such patients should be managed by clinicians with expertise in managing HCV treatment failure. Persons who attain SVR but have persistently elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels require evaluation for other causes of liver disease. Individuals for whom treatment fails can often be successfully retreated; see the online HCV guidance for management and antiviral regimen recommendations for treatment-experienced persons. If retreatment is delayed or not feasible, assessment for liver disease progression every 6-12 months is recommended, as specified in Fig. 2. Advise all patients, regardless of SVR, to avoid excess alcohol intake to prevent liver damage. The simplified HCV treatment algorithm for adults with compensated cirrhosis (see Fig. 3) applies to persons aged \u2265 18 years who have not been previously treated for their infection and have evidence of compensated cirrhosis (i.e., Child-Turcotte-Pugh [CTP] class A) but not decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., CTP class B or C). Noninvasive evidence of cirrhosis mirrors the parameters specified in the previous section and are shown in Fig. 3. Calculation of the CTP score is recommended to differentiate compensated versus decompensated cirrhosis. A CTP score \u2265 7 or any history of decompensation disqualifies these patients for the simplified treatment algorithm. Recommended pretreatment assessment also includes clinical evaluation for ascites and hepatic encephalopathy and ultrasound imaging of the liver within the prior 6 months to evaluate for HCC and subclinical ascites; any of these clinical or imaging findings are contraindications to use of the simplified treatment algorithm. See the online HCV guidance for treatment and management of persons with decompensated cirrhosis. Other circumstances and comorbid conditions that disqualify a patient for use of the simplified treatment algorithm mirror those described in the previous section and are shown in Fig. 3. Similarly, medication reconciliation, assessment for potential drug\u2013drug interactions, and pretreatment education and counseling are the same as for treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis (see Fig. 3). Pretreatment laboratory assessment of patients with compensated cirrhosis eligible for use of the simplified treatment algorithm includes complete blood count (CBC), INR, a hepatic function panel, and eGFR within 3 months of initiating antiviral therapy. Quantitative HCV-RNA, HIV-antigen/antibody, and HBsAg tests are recommended any time prior to initiating DAA therapy. Notably, pretreatment genotype testing is recommended if sofosbuvir/velpatasvir therapy is planned because of the necessity for baseline RAS testing in persons with cirrhosis and genotype 3 infection. Because new-onset hepatic decompensation develops rarely during HCV DAA treatment, clinicians may opt for on-treatment blood tests to detect liver injury. Patients who experience deteriorating hepatic laboratory parameters and/or new-onset jaundice, ascites, encephalopathy, or other new liver-related signs or symptoms should promptly see a liver specialist. On-treatment monitoring of blood glucose levels and INR are recommended for persons on diabetes medications or warfarin, respectively, with dosage adjustments as warranted (see previous section for a more detailed discussion). Multiple rigorous clinical trials have demonstrated the safety139 and high curative efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir148, 174-177 and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir160, 162-164, 171, 178-180 among treatment-naive adults with compensated cirrhosis, regardless of HCV genotype. These findings have been confirmed in real-world cohort studies for both glecaprevir/pibrentasvir153, 165-167, 181-183 and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.169, 170, 184-189 Based on these data, recommended regimens for adults eligible for the simplified treatment algorithm are 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for patients with genotype 1-6 or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for those with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. Pretreatment RAS testing is recommended for persons with genotype 3 because only those without a baseline NS5A Y93H RAS are eligible for a 12-week course of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Patients with genotype 3 and a baseline Y93H RAS should be treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or an alternative regimen (see the online HCV guidance). HCV-RNA and aminotransferase testing are recommended 12 or more weeks after completion of DAA therapy to assess treatment response. Undetectable HCV RNA represents SVR and virologic cure. Ultrasound surveillance for HCC (with or without alpha-fetoprotein testing) every 6 months after treatment completion is recommended for patients with cirrhosis, regardless of achieving SVR.78 Upper endoscopic surveillance for esophageal varices is recommended, consistent with AASLD guidance on portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis.190 Advise all patients to abstain from alcohol use to reduce the risk of liver disease progression. Risk-reduction counseling is recommended for persons with ongoing HCV risk factors. HCV-RNA testing annually or anytime an increase in hepatic aminotransferase levels occurs is also recommended for these persons. Recurrent HCV viremia after attainment of SVR represents either reinfection or a relapse.172, 173 With reinfection, the treatment approaches are identical to those for initial treatment. If relapse is suspected or cannot be ruled out, such patients should be managed by clinicians with expertise in managing HCV tre",

    "abstract_text": "Proteolytic cleavage regulates numerous processes in health and disease. One key player is the ubiquitously expressed serine protease furin, which cleaves a plethora of proteins at polybasic recognition motifs. Mammalian substrates of furin include cytokines, hormones, growth factors and receptors. Thus, it is not surprising that aberrant furin activity is associated with a variety of disorders including cancer. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of furin is exploited by numerous viral and bacterial pathogens, thereby enhancing their virulence and spread. In this review, we describe the physiological and pathophysiological substrates of furin and discuss how dysregulation of a simple proteolytic cleavage event may promote infectious diseases and cancer. One major focus is the role of furin in viral glycoprotein maturation and pathogenicity. We also outline cellular mechanisms regulating the expression and activation of furin and summarise current approaches that target this protease for therapeutic intervention.",

Highly pathogenic infections, with long-lived infective stages, tend to produce cyclic behavior in their host populations. The models give an explanation of the 9- to 10-year population cycles of the larch bud moth (Zeiraphera diniana) in the European Alps and suggest that microsporidian protozoan and baculovirus infections may be responsible for the 5- to 12-year population cycles observed in many temperate forest insects.",

    "abstract_text": "The interval between successive cases of an infectious disease is determined by the time from infection to infectiousness, the duration of infectiousness, the time from infection to disease onset (incubation period), the duration of any extra-human phase of the infectious agent, and the proportion clinically affected among infected individuals. The interval is important in the interpretation of infectious disease surveillance and trend data, in the identification of outbreaks, and in the optimization of quarantine and contact tracing. This paper discusses the properties of these intervals, as measured between transmission events or between clinical onsets of successive infected individuals, noting the determinants of their ranges and frequency distributions, the circumstances under which secondary cases may arise before primaries, and under which the infection transmission interval will be different from the interval between clinical onsets of successive cases. It discusses the derivation of interval distribution statistics from descriptive data given in standard textbooks, with illustrations from published data on outbreaks, households, and epidemiologic tracing. Finally, it discusses the implications of such measures for studies of secondary attack rates, for the persistence of infection in human communities, for outbreak response, and for elimination or eradication programs.",

    "abstract_text": "Infectious disease immunology has largely focused on the effector immune response, changes in the blood and peripheral lymphoid organs of infected individuals, and vaccine development. Studies of the thymus in infected individuals have been neglected, although this is progressively changing. The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ, able to generate mature T cells that eventually colonize secondary lymphoid organs, and is therefore essential for peripheral T cell renewal. Recent data show that normal thymocyte development and export can be altered as a result of an infectious disease. One common feature is the severe atrophy of the infected organ, mainly due to the apoptosis-related depletion of immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Additionally, thymocyte proliferation is frequently diminished. The microenvironmental compartment of the thymus is also affected, particularly in acute infectious diseases, with a densification of the epithelial network and an increase in the deposition of extracellular matrix. In the murine model of Chagas disease, intrathymic chemokine production is also enhanced, and thymocytes from Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mice exhibit greater numbers of cell migration-related receptors for chemokines and extracellular matrix, as well as increased migratory responses to the corresponding ligands. This profile is correlated with the appearance of potentially autoreactive thymus-derived immature CD4+CD8+ T cells in peripheral organs of infected animals. A variety of infectious agents\u2014including viruses, protozoa, and fungi\u2014invade the thymus, raising the hypothesis of the generation of central immunological tolerance for at least some of the infectious agent-derived antigens. It seems clear that the thymus is targeted in a variety of infections, and that such targeting may have consequences on the behavior of peripheral T lymphocytes. In this context, thymus-centered immunotherapeutic approaches potentially represent a new tool for the treatment of severe infectious diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract: Increasing evidence implicates periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the tooth\u2010supporting structures, as a potential risk factor for increased morbidity or mortality for several systemic conditions including cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis, heart attack, and stroke), pregnancy complications (spontaneous preterm birth [SPB]), and diabetes mellitus. Cross\u2010sectional, case\u2013control, and cohort studies indicate that periodontitis may confer two\u2010 and up to sevenfold increase in the risk for cardiovascular disease and premature birth, respectively. Given the recently acquired knowledge that systemic inflammation may contribute in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and may predispose to premature birth, research in the field of periodontics has focused on the potential of this chronic low\u2010grade inflammatory condition to contribute to the generation of a systemic inflammatory phenotype. Consistent with this hypothesis clinical studies demonstrate that periodontitis patients have elevated markers of systemic inflammation, such as C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL\u20106), haptoglobin, and fibrinogen. These are higher in periodontal patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than in patients with AMI alone, supporting the notion that periodontal disease is an independent contributor to systemic inflammation. In the case of adverse pregnancy outcomes, studies on fetal cord blood from SBP babies indicate a strong in utero IgM antibody response specific to several oral periodontal pathogens, which induces an inflammatory response at the fetal\u2013placental unit, leading to prematurity. The importance of periodontal infections to systemic health is further strengthened by pilot intervention trials indicating that periodontal therapy may improve surrogate cardiovascular outcomes, such as endothelial function, and may reduce four\u2010 to fivefold the incidence of premature birth. Nevertheless, further research is needed to fully discern the underlying mechanisms by which local chronic infections can have an impact on systemic health, and in this endeavor periodontal disease may serve as an ideal disease model.",

It is intended as a guide for the use of antimicrobial agents in managing patients with cancer who experience chemotherapy-induced fever and neutropenia. Recent advances in antimicrobial drug development and technology, clinical trial results, and extensive clinical experience have informed the approaches and recommendations herein. Because the previous iteration of this guideline in 2002, we have a developed a clearer definition of which populations of patients with cancer may benefit most from antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral prophylaxis. Furthermore, categorizing neutropenic patients as being at high risk or low risk for infection according to presenting signs and symptoms, underlying cancer, type of therapy, and medical comorbidities has become essential to the treatment algorithm. Risk stratification is a recommended starting point for managing patients with fever and neutropenia. In addition, earlier detection of invasive fungal infections has led to debate regarding optimal use of empirical or preemptive antifungal therapy, although algorithms are still evolving. What has not changed is the indication for immediate empirical antibiotic therapy. It remains true that all patients who present with fever and neutropenia should be treated swiftly and broadly with antibiotics to treat both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. Finally, we note that all Panel members are from institutions in the United States or Canada; thus, these guidelines were developed in the context of North American practices. Some recommendations may not be as applicable outside of North America, in areas where differences in available antibiotics, in the predominant pathogens, and/or in health care-associated economic conditions exist. Regardless of venue, clinical vigilance and immediate treatment are the universal keys to managing neutropenic patients with fever and/or infection.",

Both defects result in the selective impairment of cellular responses to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) other than TLR3 and of cellular responses to most interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs), including IL-1R, IL-18R, and IL-33R. Hypomorphic mutations in the X-linked NEMO gene and hypermorphic mutations in the autosomal IKBA gene cause X-linked recessive and autosomal dominant anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID) syndromes. Both of these defects impair NF-\u03baB-mediated cellular responses to multiple receptors, including TLRs, IL-1Rs, and tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNF-Rs). They therefore confer a much broader predisposition to infections than that for IRAK-4 and MyD88 deficiencies. These disorders were initially thought to be rare but have now been diagnosed in over 170 patients worldwide. We review here the infectious diseases affecting patients with inborn errors of NF-\u03baB-dependent TLR and IL-1R immunity.",

Field experiments on the collared flycatcher ( Ficedula albicollis ) have demonstrated a number of trade-offs between life-history traits at different ages. The mechanism by which reproductive effort is mediated into future reproductive performance remains obscure. Anti-parasite adaptations such as cell-mediated immunity may probably also be costly. Hence the possibility exists of a trade-off between reproductive effort and the ability to resist parasitic infection. Serological tests on unmanipulated collared flycatchers show that pre-breeding nutritional status correlates positively with reproductive success and negatively with susceptibility to parasitism (viruses, bacteria and protozoan parasites). Both immune response and several indicators of infectious disease correlate negatively with reproductive success. Similar relations are found between secondary sexual characters and infection parameters. For brood-size-manipulated birds there was a significant interaction between experimentally increased reproductive effort and parasitic infection rate with regard to both current and future fecundity. It seems possible that the interaction between parasitic infection, nutrition and reproductive effort can be an important mechanism in the ultimate shaping of life-history variation in avian populations.",

The majority of microbiological pathogens ingested never reaches the intestine because of the gastric barrier. Although gastric hypochlorhydria is fairly common due to atrophic gastritis, gastric surgery or use of inhibitors of gastric acid secretion, the resulting susceptibility to infection has not been studied extensively. Drug\u2010induced blockade of acid secretion leads to gastrointestinal bacterial overgrowth; the clinical significance of this is still controversial. Gastric acidity is known to protect against non\u2010typhoid salmonellosis and cholera and it is suspected that it protects against several parasitic diseases as giardiasis and strongyloides. There is a lack of studies focusing on the impact of the gastric acidic barrier on viral infections. Concerning prion infections only a single study has been performed, demonstrating a possible role of gastric acidity in the protection against foodborne prion disease in mice. The combination of malnutrition and hypochlorhydria may contribute to the high prevalence of gastrointestinal infections in developing countries. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical consequences of impaired gastric acidity with respect to susceptibility to infections.",

However, most surveillance and notification systems are affected by a degree of underestimation (UE) and therefore uncertainty surrounds the 'true' incidence of disease affecting morbidity and mortality rates. Surveillance systems fail to capture cases at two distinct levels of the surveillance pyramid: from the community since not all cases seek healthcare (under-ascertainment), and at the healthcare-level, representing a failure to adequately report symptomatic cases that have sought medical advice (underreporting). There are several methods to estimate the extent of under-ascertainment and underreporting.Within the context of the ECDC-funded Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE)-project, an extensive literature review was conducted to identify studies that estimate ascertainment or reporting rates for salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis in European Union Member States (MS) plus European Free Trade Area (EFTA) countries Iceland, Norway and Switzerland and four other OECD countries (USA, Canada, Australia and Japan). Multiplication factors (MFs), a measure of the magnitude of underestimation, were taken directly from the literature or derived (where the proportion of underestimated, under-ascertained, or underreported cases was known) and compared for the two pathogens.MFs varied between and within diseases and countries, representing a need to carefully select the most appropriate MFs and methods for calculating them. The most appropriate MFs are often disease-, country-, age-, and sex-specific.When routine data are used to make decisions on resource allocation or to estimate epidemiological parameters in populations, it becomes important to understand when, where and to what extent these data represent the true picture of disease, and in some instances (such as priority setting) it is necessary to adjust for underestimation. MFs can be used to adjust notification and surveillance data to provide more realistic estimates of incidence.",

    "abstract_text": "The spread of infectious diseases crucially depends on the pattern of contacts between individuals. Knowledge of these patterns is thus essential to inform models and computational efforts. However, there are few empirical studies available that provide estimates of the number and duration of contacts between social groups. Moreover, their space and time resolutions are limited, so that data are not explicit at the person-to-person level, and the dynamic nature of the contacts is disregarded. In this study, we aimed to assess the role of data-driven dynamic contact patterns between individuals, and in particular of their temporal aspects, in shaping the spread of a simulated epidemic in the population. We considered high-resolution data about face-to-face interactions between the attendees at a conference, obtained from the deployment of an infrastructure based on radiofrequency identification (RFID) devices that assessed mutual face-to-face proximity. The spread of epidemics along these interactions was simulated using an SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model, using both the dynamic network of contacts defined by the collected data, and two aggregated versions of such networks, to assess the role of the data temporal aspects. We show that, on the timescales considered, an aggregated network taking into account the daily duration of contacts is a good approximation to the full resolution network, whereas a homogeneous representation that retains only the topology of the contact network fails to reproduce the size of the epidemic. These results have important implications for understanding the level of detail needed to correctly inform computational models for the study and management of real epidemics.

    "abstract_text": "Human populations are arranged in social networks that determine interactions and influence the spread of diseases, behaviours and ideas. We evaluate the spread of long-term emotional states across a social network. We introduce a novel form of the classical susceptible\u2013infected\u2013susceptible disease model which includes the possibility for \u2018spontaneous\u2019 (or \u2018automatic\u2019) infection, in addition to disease transmission (the SISa model). Using this framework and data from the Framingham Heart Study, we provide formal evidence that positive and negative emotional states behave like infectious diseases spreading across social networks over long periods of time. The probability of becoming content is increased by 0.02 per year for each content contact, and the probability of becoming discontent is increased by 0.04 per year per discontent contact. Our mathematical formalism allows us to derive various quantities from the data, such as the average lifetime of a contentment \u2018infection\u2019 (10 years) or discontentment \u2018infection\u2019 (5 years). Our results give insight into the transmissive nature of positive and negative emotional states. Determining to what extent particular emotions or behaviours are infectious is a promising direction for further research with important implications for social science, epidemiology and health policy. Our model provides a theoretical framework for studying the interpersonal spread of any state that may also arise spontaneously, such as emotions, behaviours, health states, ideas or diseases with reservoirs.",

The advances in the realism of epidemic description call for the explicit modeling of individual behavioral responses to the presence of disease within modeling frameworks. Here we formulate and analyze a metapopulation model that incorporates several scenarios of self-initiated behavioral changes into the mobility patterns of individuals. We find that prevalence-based travel limitations do not alter the epidemic invasion threshold. Strikingly, we observe in both synthetic and data-driven numerical simulations that when travelers decide to avoid locations with high levels of prevalence, this self-initiated behavioral change may enhance disease spreading. Our results point out that the real-time availability of information on the disease and the ensuing behavioral changes in the population may produce a negative impact on disease containment and mitigation.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract Infectious disease outbreaks recapitulate biology: they emerge from the multi-level interaction of hosts, pathogens, and environment. Therefore, outbreak forecasting requires an integrative approach to modeling. While specific components of outbreaks are predictable, it remains unclear whether fundamental limits to outbreak prediction exist. Here, adopting permutation entropy as a model independent measure of predictability, we study the predictability of a diverse collection of outbreaks and identify a fundamental entropy barrier for disease time series forecasting. However, this barrier is often beyond the time scale of single outbreaks, implying prediction is likely to succeed. We show that forecast horizons vary by disease and that both shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are likely mechanisms for differences in predictability. Our results highlight the importance of embracing dynamic modeling approaches, suggest challenges for performing model selection across long time series, and may relate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.",

New antimicrobial agents are greatly needed to treat infections caused by gram-negative bacilli (GNB) resistant to currently available agents. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) continues to propose legislative, regulatory, and funding solutions to this continuing crisis. The current report updates the status of development and approval of systemic antibiotics in the United States as of early 2013. Only 2 new antibiotics have been approved since IDSA's 2009 pipeline status report, and the number of new antibiotics annually approved for marketing in the United States continues to decline. We identified 7 drugs in clinical development for treatment of infections caused by resistant GNB. None of these agents was included in our 2009 list of antibacterial compounds in phase 2 or later development, but unfortunately none addresses the entire spectrum of clinically relevant GNB resistance. Our survey demonstrates some progress in development of new antibacterial drugs that target infections caused by resistant GNB, but progress remains alarmingly elusive. IDSA stresses our conviction that the antibiotic pipeline problem can be solved by the collaboration of global leaders to develop creative incentives that will stimulate new antibacterial research and development. Our aim is the creation of a sustainable global antibacterial drug research and development enterprise with the power in the short term to develop 10 new, safe, and efficacious systemically administered antibiotics by 2020 as called for in IDSA's \"10 \u00d7 '20 Initiative.\"",

    "abstract_text": "Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a potent immunoregulatory cytokine that is crucially involved in a wide range of infectious diseases. In several experimental models of bacterial, parasitic, viral, and fungal infection, endogenous IL-12 is required for early control of infection and for generation and perhaps maintenance of acquired protective immunity, directed by T helper type 1 (Th1) cells and mediated by phagocytes. Although the relative roles of IL-12 and gamma interferon in Th1-cell priming may be to a significant extent pathogen dependent, common to most infections is that IL-12 regulates the magnitude of the gamma interferon response at the initiation of infection, thus potentiating natural resistance, favoring Th1-cell development; and inhibiting Th2 responses. Treatment of animals with IL-12, either alone or as a vaccine adjuvant, has been shown to prevent disease by many of the same infectious agents, by stimulating innate resistance or promoting specific reactivity. Although IL-12 may enhance protective memory responses in vaccination or in combination with antimicrobial chemotherapy, it is yet unclear whether exogenous IL-12 can alter established responses in humans. Continued investigation into the possible application of IL-12 therapy to human infections is warranted by the role of the cytokine in inflammation, immunopathology, and autoimmunity.",

Infectious diseases are among the primary constraints to swine production, and the globalization of the swine industry has contributed to the emergence and spread of pathogens. Despite the importance of infectious diseases to animal health and the stability and productivity of the global swine industry, pathogens of swine have never been reviewed at a global scale. Here, we build a holistic global picture of research on swine pathogens to enhance preparedness and understand patterns of emergence and spread. By conducting a scoping review of more than 57,000 publications across 50 years, we identify priority pathogens globally and regionally, and characterize geographic and temporal trends in research priorities. Of the 40 identified pathogens, publication rates for eight pathogens increased faster than overall trends, suggesting that these pathogens may be emerging or constitute an increasing threat. We also compared regional patterns of pathogen prioritization in the context of policy differences, history of outbreaks, and differing swine health challenges faced in regions where swine production has become more industrialized. We documented a general increasing trend in importance of zoonotic pathogens and show that structural changes in the industry related to intensive swine production shift pathogen prioritization. Multinational collaboration networks were strongly shaped by region, colonial ties, and pig trade networks. This review represents the most comprehensive overview of research on swine infectious diseases to date.",

Currently there is worldwide alert for H5N1 avian influenza becoming as transmissible in humans as seasonal influenza, and potentially causing a pandemic of unprecedented proportions. Here we show how epidemiological surveillance data for emerging infectious diseases can be interpreted in real time to assess changes in transmissibility with quantified uncertainty, and to perform running time predictions of new cases and guide logistics allocations.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe develop an extension of standard epidemiological models, appropriate for emerging infectious diseases, that describes the probabilistic progression of case numbers due to the concurrent effects of (incipient) human transmission and multiple introductions from a reservoir. The model is cast in terms of surveillance observables and immediately suggests a simple graphical estimation procedure for the effective reproductive number R (mean number of cases generated by an infectious individual) of standard epidemics. For emerging infectious diseases, which typically show large relative case number fluctuations over time, we develop a Bayesian scheme for real time estimation of the probability distribution of the effective reproduction number and show how to use such inferences to formulate significance tests on future epidemiological observations.Conclusions/SignificanceViolations of these significance tests define statistical anomalies that may signal changes in the epidemiology of emerging diseases and should trigger further field investigation. We apply the methodology to case data from World Health Organization reports to place bounds on the current transmissibility of H5N1 influenza in humans and establish a statistical basis for monitoring its evolution in real time.",

All six of the genes that have a major effect on infectious disease susceptibility in humans have been identified in this way.

Other approaches used successfully have included assessment in humans of the homologues of susceptibility genes mapped and identified in murine models.

Diseases most likely to increase in their distribution and severity have three-factor (agent, vector, and human being) and four-factor (plus vertebrate reservoir host) ecology. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes may move northward and have more rapid metamorphosis with global warming. These mosquitoes transmit dengue virus, and Aedes aegypti transmits yellow fever virus. The faster metamorphosis and a shorter extrinsic incubation of dengue and yellow fever viruses could lead to epidemics in North America. Vibrio cholerae is harbored persistently in the estuaries of the U.S. Gulf Coast. Over the past 200 years, cholera has become pandemic seven times with spread from Asia to Europe, Africa, and North America. Global warming may lead to changes in water ecology that could enhance similar spread of cholera in North America. Some other infectious diseases such as LaCrosse encephalitis and Lyme disease are caused by agents closely dependent on the integrity of their environment. These diseases may become less prominent with global warming because of anticipated modification of their habitats. Ecological studies will help us to understand more fully the possible consequences of global warming. New and more effective methods for control of vectors will be needed.",

    "abstract_text": "Aquaculture is rapidly growing part of agriculture worldwide. It makes up around 44 percent of total fish production globally. This increased growth of production is achieved despite facing many challenges in the aquaculture environment. Among production limiting challenges, the infectious disease takes the lion share by causing multibillion-dollar loss annually. To reduce the impact of the fish disease, it is necessary to address health constraints based on scientifically proven and recommended ways. This review aims at pointing out some of the best approaches to prevention and control of infectious disease in aquaculture. Among the effective prevention and control strategies, vaccination is one of the key practices. Types of vaccines for use in fish include killed vaccines, attenuated vaccines, DNA vaccines, recombinant technology vaccines, and synthetic peptide vaccines. Administration techniques of vaccines in fish include oral, injection, or immersion methods. Antibiotics are also in use in aquaculture despite their side effects in the development of drug resistance by microorganisms. Biological and chemical disease control strategies such as using probiotics, prebiotics, and medicinal plants are widely in use. Biosecurity measures in aquaculture can keep the safety of a facility from certain disease-causing agents that are absent in particular system. Farm-level biosecurity measures include strict quarantine measures, egg disinfection, traffic control, water treatments, clean feed, and disposal of mortalities. In conclusion, rather than trying to treat every disease case, it advisable to follow a preventive approach before the event of any disease outbreaks.",

    "abstract_text": "In the preantibiotic era, passive antibody administration (serum therapy) was useful for the treatment of many infectious diseases. The introduction of antimicrobial chemotherapy in the 1940s led to the rapid abandonment of many forms of passive antibody therapy. Chemotherapy was more effective and less toxic than antibody therapy. In this last decade of the 20th century the efficacy of antimicrobial chemotherapy is diminishing because of the rapidly escalating number of immunocompromised individuals, the emergence of new pathogens, the reemergence of old pathogens, and widespread development of resistance to antimicrobial drugs. This diminishment in the effectiveness of chemotherapy has been paralleled by advances in monoclonal antibody technology that have made feasible the generation of human antibodies. This combination of factors makes passive antibody therapy an option worthy of serious consideration. We propose that for every pathogen there exists an antibody that will modify the infection to the benefit of the host. Such antibodies are potential antimicrobial agents. Antibody-based therapies have significant advantages and disadvantages relative to standard chemotherapy. The reintroduction of antibody-based therapy would require major changes in the practices of infectious disease specialists.",

These diseases can also completely transform the ecosystems that feed us and provide us with other critical benefits, from flood control to water purification. And yet diseases sometimes serve to maintain the structure and function of the ecosystems on which humans depend. Gathering thirteen essays by forty leading experts who convened at the Cary Conference at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in 2005, this book develops an integrated framework for understanding where these diseases come from, what ecological factors influence their impacts, and how they in turn influence ecosystem dynamics. It marks the first comprehensive and in-depth exploration of the rich and complex linkages between ecology and disease, and provides conceptual underpinnings to understand and ameliorate epidemics. It also sheds light on the roles that diseases play in ecosystems, bringing vital new insights to landscape management issues in particular. While the ecological context is a key piece of the puzzle, effective control and understanding of diseases requires the interaction of professionals in medicine, epidemiology, veterinary medicine, forestry, agriculture, and ecology. The essential resource on the subject, Infectious Disease Ecology seeks to bridge these fields with an ecological approach that focuses on systems thinking and complex interactions.",

    "abstract_text": "Invasive fungal infections are a leading cause of mortality among immunocompromised individuals. Treatment is notoriously difficult with the limited armamentarium of antifungal drugs, whose efficacy is compromised by host toxicity, a limited activity spectrum, or the emergence of drug resistance. We previously established that the molecular chaperone Hsp90 enables the emergence and maintenance of fungal drug resistance. For the most prevalent fungal pathogen of humans, Candida albicans, Hsp90 mediates resistance to azoles, which inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis and are the most widely deployed antifungals in the clinic. For the emerging opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus terreus, Hsp90 is required for basal resistance to echinocandins, which inhibit beta(1, 3)-glucan synthesis and are the only new class of antifungals to reach the clinic in decades. Here, we explore the therapeutic potential of Hsp90 inhibitors in fungal disease using a tractable host-model system, larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella, and a murine model of disseminated disease. Combination therapy with Hsp90 inhibitors that are well tolerated in humans and an azole rescued larvae from lethal C. albicans infections. Combination therapy with an Hsp90 inhibitor and an echinocandin rescued larvae from infections with the most lethal mold, Aspergillus fumigatus. In a murine model of disseminated candidiasis, genetic compromise of C. albicans HSP90 expression enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of an azole. Thus, harnessing Hsp90 provides a much-needed strategy for improving the treatment of fungal disease because it enhances the efficacy of existing antifungals, blocks the emergence of drug resistance, and exerts broad-spectrum activity against diverse fungal pathogens.",

    "abstract_text": "We devote a special issue of the Journal of Infectious Diseases to review the recent advances of big data in strengthening disease surveillance, monitoring medical adverse events, informing transmission models, and tracking patient sentiments and mobility. We consider a broad definition of big data for public health, one encompassing patient information gathered from high-volume electronic health records and participatory surveillance systems, as well as mining of digital traces such as social media, Internet searches, and cell-phone logs. We introduce nine independent contributions to this special issue and highlight several cross-cutting areas that require further research, including representativeness, biases, volatility, and validation, and the need for robust statistical and hypotheses-driven analyses. Overall, we are optimistic that the big-data revolution will vastly improve the granularity and timeliness of available epidemiological information, with hybrid systems augmenting rather than supplanting traditional surveillance systems, and better prospects for accurate infectious diseases models and forecasts.",

    "abstract_text": "In today's global society, infectious disease outbreaks can spread quickly across the world, fueled by the rapidity with which we travel across borders and continents. Historical accounts of influenza pandemics and contemporary reports on infectious diseases clearly demonstrate that poverty, inequality, and social determinants of health create conditions for the transmission of infectious diseases, and existing health disparities or inequalities can further contribute to unequal burdens of morbidity and mortality. Yet, to date, studies of influenza pandemic plans across multiple countries find little to no recognition of health inequalities or attempts to engage disadvantaged populations to explicitly address the differential impact of a pandemic on them. To meet the goals and objectives of the Global Health Security Agenda, we argue that international partners, from WHO to individual countries, must grapple with the social determinants of health and existing health inequalities and extend their vision to include these factors so that disease that may start among socially disadvantaged subpopulations does not go unnoticed and spread across borders. These efforts will require rethinking surveillance systems to include sociodemographic data; training local teams of researchers and community health workers who are able to not only analyze data to recognize risk factors for disease, but also use simulation methods to assess the impact of alternative policies on reducing disease; integrating social science disciplines to understand local context; and proactively anticipating shortfalls in availability of adequate healthcare resources, including vaccines. Without explicit attention to existing health inequalities and underlying social determinants of health, the Global Health Security Agenda is unlikely to succeed in its goals and objectives.",

Following the Cochrane collaboration guidelines and the PRISMA statement, our systematic search and selection yielded 178 papers covering the period 2010-2015. We observe an increasing trend in published BCMs, frequently coupled to (re)emergence events, and propose a categorization by distinguishing how information translates into preventive actions. Behaviour is usually captured by introducing information as a dynamic parameter (76/178) or by introducing an economic objective function, either with (26/178) or without (37/178) imitation. Approaches using information thresholds (29/178) and exogenous behaviour formation (16/178) are also popular. We further classify according to disease, prevention measure, transmission model (with 81/178 population, 6/178 metapopulation and 91/178 individual-level models) and the way prevention impacts transmission. We highlight the minority (15%) of studies that use any real-life data for parametrization or validation and note that BCMs increasingly use social media data and generally incorporate multiple sources of information (16/178), multiple types of information (17/178) or both (9/178). We conclude that individual-level models are increasingly used and useful to model behaviour changes. Despite recent advancements, we remain concerned that most models are purely theoretical and lack representative data and a validation process.",

Much of our knowledge of infections in the elderly is based on clinical experience and lacks a firm scientific foundation. The increased risk of infections observed with aging may be due to physiologic changes that accompany \"normal\" aging or the age-associated chronic diseases and the medical, surgical, and diagnostic interventions that accompany them. Epidemiologic studies on populations of well and hospitalized older persons in defined age ranges are needed to examine the relation between specific infectious diseases and risk factors. Although the increased susceptibility of older persons to infectious diseases frequently has been attributed to the decline in immune function that occurs with aging, there are very few data confirming this hypothesis. Additional research is clearly needed on other contributory factors such as nutrition, ciliary transport, bacterial adherence, neutrophil and macrophage function, and complement.",

    "abstract_text": "Liposomes are closed bilayer structures spontaneously formed by hydrated phospholipids that are widely used as efficient delivery systems for drugs or antigens, due to their capability to encapsulate bioactive hydrophilic, amphipathic, and lipophilic molecules into inner water phase or within lipid leaflets. The efficacy of liposomes as drug or antigen carriers has been improved in the last years to ameliorate pharmacokinetics and capacity to release their cargo in selected target organs or cells. Moreover, different formulations and variations in liposome composition have been often proposed to include immunostimulatory molecules, ligands for specific receptors, or stimuli responsive compounds. Intriguingly, independent research has unveiled the capacity of several phospholipids to play critical roles as intracellular messengers in modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses through various mechanisms, including (i) activation of different antimicrobial enzymatic pathways, (ii) driving the fusion-fission events between endosomes with direct consequences to phagosome maturation and/or to antigen presentation pathway, and (iii) modulation of the inflammatory response. These features can be exploited by including selected bioactive phospholipids in the bilayer scaffold of liposomes. This would represent an important step forward since drug or antigen carrying liposomes could be engineered to simultaneously activate different signal transduction pathways and target specific cells or tissues to induce antigen-specific T and/or B cell response. This lipid-based host-directed strategy can provide a focused antimicrobial innate and adaptive immune response against specific pathogens and offer a novel prophylactic or therapeutic option against chronic, recurrent, or drug-resistant infections.",

We consider a very general form of the non-linear incidence rate (in fact, we assumed that the incidence rate is given by an arbitrary function f (S, I, N) constrained by a few biologically feasible conditions) and a variety of epidemiological models. We show that under the constant population size assumption, these models exhibit asymptotically stable steady states. Precisely, we demonstrate that the concavity of the incidence rate with respect to the number of infective individuals is a sufficient condition for stability. If the incidence rate is concave in the number of the infectives, the models we consider have either a unique and stable endemic equilibrium state or no endemic equilibrium state at all; in the latter case the infection-free equilibrium state is stable. For the incidence rate of the form g(I)h(S), we prove global stability, constructing a Lyapunov function and using the direct Lyapunov method. It is remarkable that the system dynamics is independent of how the incidence rate depends on the number of susceptible individuals. We demonstrate this result using a SIRS model and a SEIRS model as case studies. For other compartment epidemic models, the analysis is quite similar, and the same conclusion, namely stability of the equilibrium states, holds.",

The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of B. dendrobatidis on the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa) in the Sierra Nevada of California (USA). We (1) quantified the prevalence and incidence of B. dendrobatidis through repeat surveys of several hundred R. muscosa populations in the southern Sierra Nevada; (2) described the population-level effects of B. dendrobatidis on R. muscosa population abundance; and (3) compared the mortality rates of infected and uninfected R. muscosa individuals from pre- through post-metamorphosis using both laboratory and field experiments. Mouthpart inspections conducted in 144 and 132 R. muscosa populations in 2003 and 2004, respectively, indicated that 19% of R. muscosa populations in both years showed indications of chytridiomycosis. Sixteen percent of populations that were uninfected in 2003 became infected by 2004. Rana muscosa population sizes were reduced by an average of 88% following B. dendrobatidis outbreaks at six sites, but at seven B. dendrobatidis-negative sites, R. muscosa population sizes increased by an average of 45% over the same time period. In the laboratory, all infected R. muscosa developed fatal chytridiomycosis after metamorphosis, while all uninfected individuals remained healthy. In the field experiment in which R. muscosa tadpoles were caged at infected and uninfected sites, 96% of the individuals that metamorphosed at infected sites died vs. 5% at the uninfected sites. These studies indicate that chytridiomycosis causes high mortality in post-metamorphic R. muscosa, that this emerging disease is the proximate cause of numerous observed R. muscosa population declines, and that the disease threatens this species with extirpation at numerous sites in California's Sierra Nevada.",

Bull. 54, 523\u2013532], attributing low numbers of animal hosts to the existence of even a new pathogen is problematic. This is because very rarely does one have data on host abundance before and after the epizootic as well as detailed descriptions of pathogen prevalence [Dobson, A. P. &amp; Hudson, P. J. (1985) in Ecology of Infectious Diseases in Natural Populations , eds. Grenfell, B. T. &amp; Dobson, A. P. (Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, U.K.), pp. 52\u201389]. Month by month we tracked the spread of the epizootic of an apparently novel strain of a widespread poultry pathogen, Mycoplasma gallisepticum , through a previously unknown host, the house finch, whose abundance has been monitored over past decades. Here we are able to demonstrate a causal relationship between high disease prevalence and declining house finch abundance throughout the eastern half of North America because the epizootic reached different parts of the house finch range at different times. Three years after the epizootic arrived, house finch abundance stabilized at similar levels, although house finch abundance had been high and stable in some areas but low and rapidly increasing in others. This result, not previously documented in wild populations, is as expected from theory if transmission of the disease was density dependent.",

    "title": "Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 Guidance on the Treatment of Antimicrobial Resistant Gram-Negative Infections",
    "abstract_text": "Abstract Background The Infectious Diseases Society of America is committed to providing up-to-date guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. This guidance document focuses on infections caused by extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase\u2013producing Enterobacterales, AmpC \u03b2-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. This updated document replaces previous versions of the guidance document. Methods A panel of 6 infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated questions about the treatment of infections caused by extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, AmpC \u03b2-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and S. maltophilia. Because of differences in the epidemiology of resistance and availability of specific anti-infectives internationally, this document focuses on the treatment of infections in the United States. Results Preferred and alternative suggested treatment approaches are provided with accompanying rationales, assuming the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility results are known. Approaches to empiric treatment, transitioning to oral therapy, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are also discussed briefly. Suggested approaches apply for both adult and pediatric populations, although suggested antibiotic dosages are provided only for adults. Conclusions The field of antimicrobial-resistance is highly dynamic. Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended for the treatment of antimicrobial resistant infections. This document is current as of 31 December 2022 and will be updated periodically. The most current version of this document, including date of publication, is available at www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/amr-guidance/.",

    "abstract_text": "Climatological variation and ecological perturbation have been pervasive drivers of faunal assembly, structure and diversification for parasites and pathogens through recurrent events of geographical and host colonization at varying spatial and temporal scales of Earth history. Episodic shifts in climate and environmental settings, in conjunction with ecological mechanisms and host switching, are often critical determinants of parasite diversification, a view counter to more than a century of coevolutionary thinking about the nature of complex host\u2013parasite assemblages. Parasites are resource specialists with restricted host ranges, yet shifts onto relatively unrelated hosts are common during phylogenetic diversification of parasite lineages and directly observable in real time. The emerging Stockholm Paradigm resolves this paradox: Ecological Fitting ( EF )\u2014phenotypic flexibility and phylogenetic conservatism in traits related to resource use, most notably host preference\u2014provides many opportunities for rapid host switching in changing environments, without the evolution of novel host-utilization capabilities. Host shifts via EF fuel the expansion phase of the Oscillation Hypothesis of host range and speciation and, more generally, the generation of novel combinations of interacting species within the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution. In synergy, an environmental dynamic of Taxon Pulses establishes an episodic context for host and geographical colonization.",

    "abstract_text": "Modern infectious disease epidemiology has a strong history of using mathematics both for prediction and to gain a deeper understanding. However the study of infectious diseases is a highly interdisciplinary subject requiring insights from multiple disciplines, in particular a biological knowledge of the pathogen, a statistical description of the available data and a mathematical framework for prediction. Here we begin with the basic building blocks of infectious disease epidemiology\u2014the SIS and SIR type models\u2014before considering the progress that has been made over the recent decades and the challenges that lie ahead. Throughout we focus on the understanding that can be developed from relatively simple models, although accurate prediction will inevitably require far greater complexity beyond the scope of this review. In particular, we focus on three critical aspects of infectious disease models that we feel fundamentally shape their dynamics: heterogeneously structured populations, stochasticity and spatial structure. Throughout we relate the mathematical models and their results to a variety of real-world problems.",

The increase in emerging infectious diseases has led to calls for new technologies and approaches for detection, tracking, reporting, and response. Internet-based surveillance systems offer a novel and developing means of monitoring conditions of public health concern, including emerging infectious diseases. We review studies that have exploited internet use and search trends to monitor two such diseases: influenza and dengue. Internet-based surveillance systems have good congruence with traditional surveillance approaches. Additionally, internet-based approaches are logistically and economically appealing. However, they do not have the capacity to replace traditional surveillance systems; they should not be viewed as an alternative, but rather an extension. Future research should focus on using data generated through internet-based surveillance and response systems to bolster the capacity of traditional surveillance systems for emerging infectious diseases.",

They are the greatest world killers and it is estimated that they are responsible for the demise of over 17 million people annually. The impact of these diseases is greater in the developing countries. People with compromised immune systems and children are the most affected. Infectious diseases may be caused by bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. The treatment of infectious diseases is hampered by simultaneous resistance to multiple drugs, indicating that there is a serious and pressing need to develop new therapeutics that can overcome drug resistance. This review will focus on the recent reports of metal-based nanoparticles that are potential therapeutics for the treatment of infectious diseases and their biological efficacy (in vitro and in vivo).",

    "abstract_text": "During the course of evolution, multicellular organisms have been orchestrated with an efficient and versatile immune system to counteract diverse group of pathogenic organisms. Pathogen recognition is considered as the most critical step behind eliciting adequate immune response during an infection. Hitherto Toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially the surface ones viz. TLR2 and TLR4 have gained immense importance due to their extreme ability of identifying distinct molecular patterns from invading pathogens. These pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) not only act as innate sensor but also shape and bridge innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, they also play a pivotal role in regulating the balance between Th1 and Th2 type of response essential for the survivability of the host. In this work, major achievements rather findings made on the typical signalling and immunopathological attributes of TLR2 and TLR4 mediated host response against the major infectious diseases have been reviewed. Infectious diseases like tuberculosis, trypanosomiasis, malaria, and filariasis are still posing myriad threat to mankind. Furthermore, increasing resistance of the causative organisms against available therapeutics is also an emerging problem. Thus, stimulation of host immune response with TLR2 and TLR4 agonist can be the option of choice to treat such diseases in future.",

Interactions between GAGs and pathogens represent the first line of contact between pathogen and host cell and are crucial to a pathogen's invasive potential. Their complexity and structural diversity allow GAGs to control a wide array of biological interactions influencing many physiological and pathological processes, including adhesion, cell\u2010to\u2010cell communication, biochemical cascades, and the immune response. In recent years, increasing evidence indicates an extraordinary role for GAGs in the pathogenesis of viruses, bacteria and parasites. Herein, we examine the interface between GAGs and different pathogens, and address the divergent biological functions of GAGs in infectious disease. We consider approaches to use this understanding to design novel therapeutic strategies addressing new challenges in the treatment of infectious diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "We reviewed prominent emerging infectious diseases of cetaceans, examined their potential to impact populations, re-assessed zoonotic risk and evaluated the role of environmental stressors. Cetacean morbilliviruses and papillomaviruses as well as Brucella spp. and Toxoplasma gondii are thought to interfere with population abundance by inducing high mortalities, lowering reproductive success or by synergistically increasing the virulence of other diseases. Severe cases of lobomycosis and lobomycosis-like disease (LLD) may contribute to the death of some dolphins. The zoonotic hazard of marine mammal brucellosis and toxoplasmosis may have been underestimated, attributable to frequent misdiagnoses and underreporting, particularly in developing countries and remote areas where carcass handling without protective gear and human consumption of fresh cetacean products are commonplace. Environmental factors seem to play a role in the emergence and pathogenicity of morbillivirus epidemics, lobomycosis/LLD, toxoplasmosis, poxvirus-associated tattoo skin disease and, in harbour porpoises, infectious diseases of multifactorial aetiology. Inshore and estuarine cetaceans incur higher risks than pelagic cetaceans due to habitats often severely altered by anthropogenic factors such as chemical and biological contamination, direct and indirect fisheries interactions, traumatic injuries from vessel collisions and climate change.",

    "abstract_text": "To determine whether recommendations of infectious diseases specialists affect outcome for patients, we evaluated 244 hospitalized patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. We offered our management recommendations to each patient's physicians and then assessed the clinical outcome for both patients for whom our consultative advice was followed and those for whom our advice was not heeded. All patients were followed up for 12 weeks after their first positive blood culture. Our management advice was followed for 112 patients (45.9%) and partially or completely ignored for 132 patients (54.1%). Patients for whom our recommendations were followed were more likely to be cured of their S. aureus infection and less likely to relapse (P < .01), despite having significantly more metastatic infections (P < .01) at the outset of therapy, than were those for whom our recommendations were not followed. Failure to follow recommendations to remove an infected intravascular device was the most important risk for treatment failure. After controlling for other factors, logistic regression analysis revealed that patients whose intravascular device was not removed were 6.5 times more likely to relapse or die of their infection than were those whose device was removed. Our findings suggest that patient-specific management advice by infectious diseases consultants can improve the clinical outcome for patients with S. aureus bacteremia.",

    "abstract_text": "The role and significance of wildlife-livestock interfaces in disease ecology has largely been neglected, despite recent interest in animals as origins of emerging diseases in humans. Scoping review methods were applied to objectively assess the relative interest by the scientific community in infectious diseases at interfaces between wildlife and livestock, to characterize animal species and regions involved, as well as to identify trends over time. An extensive literature search combining wildlife, livestock, disease, and geographical search terms yielded 78,861 publications, of which 15,998 were included in the analysis. Publications dated from 1912 to 2013 and showed a continuous increasing trend, including a shift from parasitic to viral diseases over time. In particular there was a significant increase in publications on the artiodactyls-cattle and bird-poultry interface after 2002 and 2003, respectively. These trends could be traced to key disease events that stimulated public interest and research funding. Among the top 10 diseases identified by this review, the majority were zoonoses. Prominent wildlife-livestock interfaces resulted largely from interaction between phylogenetically closely related and/or sympatric species. The bird-poultry interface was the most frequently cited wildlife-livestock interface worldwide with other interfaces reflecting regional circumstances. This review provides the most comprehensive overview of research on infectious diseases at the wildlife-livestock interface to date.",

    "abstract_text": "The increasing number of emerging infectious disease events that have spread internationally, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the 2009 pandemic A/H1N1, highlight the need for improvements in global outbreak surveillance. It is expected that the proliferation of Internet-based reports has resulted in greater communication and improved surveillance and reporting frameworks, especially with the revision of the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), which went into force in 2007. However, there has been no global quantitative assessment of whether and how outbreak detection and communication processes have actually changed over time. In this study, we analyzed the entire WHO public record of Disease Outbreak News reports from 1996 to 2009 to characterize spatial-temporal trends in the timeliness of outbreak discovery and public communication about the outbreak relative to the estimated outbreak start date. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses show that overall, the timeliness of outbreak discovery improved by 7.3% [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.073, 95% CI (1.038; 1.110)] per year, and public communication improved by 6.2% [HR = 1.062, 95% CI (1.028; 1.096)] per year. However, the degree of improvement varied by geographic region; the only WHO region with statistically significant (\u03b1 = 0.05) improvement in outbreak discovery was the Western Pacific region [HR = 1.102 per year, 95% CI (1.008; 1.205)], whereas the Eastern Mediterranean [HR = 1.201 per year, 95% CI (1.066; 1.353)] and Western Pacific regions [HR = 1.119 per year, 95% CI (1.025; 1.221)] showed improvement in public communication. These findings provide quantitative historical assessment of timeliness in infectious disease detection and public reporting of outbreaks.",

This is well illustrated by the HIV viruses, the causative agents of human AIDS, which evolved recently from related viruses of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys5), as well as by the outbreaks of Ebola virus, which trace their origins to zoonotic transmissions from local apes.6 A consideration of how environmental change may promote contact between humans and nonhuman primates and thus increase the possibility of sharing infectious diseases detrimental to humans or nonhuman primates is now paramount in conservation and human health planning.",

Thirty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Reporting completeness, expressed between 0% and 100%, was treated as the dependent outcome variable in statistical analysis; disease, study location, time period, study design, and study size were treated as independent variables. Fifty-six distinct measures of reporting completeness were identified for 21 diseases. Reporting completeness varied from 9% to 99% and was most strongly associated with the disease being reported. The mean reporting completeness for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, sexually transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis as a group was significantly higher (79%) than for all other diseases combined (49%) (p < 0.01).",

    "abstract_text": "Control of human infectious disease has been promoted as a valuable ecosystem service arising from the conservation of biodiversity. There are two commonly discussed mechanisms by which biodiversity loss could increase rates of infectious disease in a landscape. First, loss of competitors or predators could facilitate an increase in the abundance of competent reservoir hosts. Second, biodiversity loss could disproportionately affect non\u2010competent, or less competent reservoir hosts, which would otherwise interfere with pathogen transmission to human populations by, for example, wasting the bites of infected vectors. A negative association between biodiversity and disease risk, sometimes called the \u201cdilution effect hypothesis,\u201d has been supported for a few disease agents, suggests an exciting win\u2013win outcome for the environment and society, and has become a pervasive topic in the disease ecology literature. Case studies have been assembled to argue that the dilution effect is general across disease agents. Less touted are examples in which elevated biodiversity does not affect or increases infectious disease risk for pathogens of public health concern. In order to assess the likely generality of the dilution effect, we review the association between biodiversity and public health across a broad variety of human disease agents. Overall, we hypothesize that conditions for the dilution effect are unlikely to be met for most important diseases of humans. Biodiversity probably has little net effect on most human infectious diseases but, when it does have an effect, observation and basic logic suggest that biodiversity will be more likely to increase than to decrease infectious disease risk.",

Each acute infectious disease has its own seasonal window of occurrence, which, importantly, may vary among geographic locations and differ from other diseases within  same location. Here we explore  concept of an epidemic calendar, which is  idea that seasonality is a unifying feature of epidemic-prone diseases and, in  absence of control measures,  local calendar can be marked by epidemics (Fig 1). A well-known example of a calendar marked by epidemics is that of  Northern Hemisphere, where influenza outbreaks occur each winter [2, 3] (hence  colloquial reference to winter as the flu season). In contrast, chickenpox outbreaks peak each spring [4, 5], and polio transmission historically occurred each summer [6].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen in a separate window\r\n\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\nEpidemic calendar.\r\nThe concept of an epidemic calendar is illustrated in  top panel. Infectious diseases are seasonal, especially  occurrence of acute and epidemic-prone diseases. In any given population, infectious diseases are distributed throughout  year. Annual cycles of infectious disease are a ubiquitous feature of infection (Tables \u200b(Tables11\u20134). The illustration depicts  wintertime seasonality of flu, springtime peaks of varicella (i.e., chickenpox), and  summertime occurrence of gonorrhea and polio, in  Northern Hemisphere. The bottom panel is a SIR schematic for  transmission of human infectious diseases, which include acute and chronic diseases, those that are vector-borne, and those that are zoonotic with animal reservoirs. The vector, human, and reservoir hosts populations are partitioned into individuals who are susceptible to infection, infected, and recovered and immune. Seasonality may enter into any of  eight key elements of  system: (1) susceptible recruitment via reproduction, (2) transmission, (3) acquired immunity and recovery, (4) waning immunity, (5) natural mortality, (6) symptomatology and pathology (which may be acute or chronic, depending on  disease), (7) disease-induced mortality, and (8) cross-species transmission.

    "abstract_text": "Contamination of food and feed with mycotoxins is a worldwide problem. At present, acute mycotoxicosis caused by high doses is rare in humans and animals. Ingestion of low to moderate amounts of Fusarium mycotoxins is common and generally does not result in obvious intoxication. However, these low amounts may impair intestinal health, immune function and/or pathogen fitness, resulting in altered host pathogen interactions and thus a different outcome of infection. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about the impact of Fusarium mycotoxin exposure on human and animal host susceptibility to infectious diseases. On the one hand, exposure to deoxynivalenol and other Fusarium mycotoxins generally exacerbates infections with parasites, bacteria and viruses across a wide range of animal host species. Well-known examples include coccidiosis in poultry, salmonellosis in pigs and mice, colibacillosis in pigs, necrotic enteritis in poultry, enteric septicemia of catfish, swine respiratory disease, aspergillosis in poultry and rabbits, reovirus infection in mice and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus infection in pigs. However, on the other hand, T-2 toxin has been shown to markedly decrease the colonization capacity of Salmonella in the pig intestine. Although the impact of the exposure of humans to Fusarium toxins on infectious diseases is less well known, extrapolation from animal models suggests possible exacerbation of, for instance, colibacillosis and salmonellosis in humans, as well.",

Where they provided supportive evidence, patient studies were selected on the basis of study design.TNF plays a key role in the normal immune response to infection, limiting the spread of pathogens. Exaggerated physiologic responses occur under the influence of high concentrations of TNF that are released in response to overwhelming infection, resulting in aberrations in coagulation, cell adhesion, chemotaxis/transmigration, and vascular integrity. These pathologic effects may be inhibited by anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies and recombinant soluble receptor inhibitory proteins.TNF exerts both physiologic and pathologic effects in response to infection; these events may lead to organ dysfunction and death.

    "abstract_text": "Many extensions of survival models based on the Cox proportional hazards approach have been proposed to handle clustered or multiple event data. Of particular note are five Cox-based models for recurrent event data: Andersen and Gill (AG); Wei, Lin and Weissfeld (WLW); Prentice, Williams and Peterson, total time (PWP-CP) and gap time (PWP-GT); and Lee, Wei and Amato (LWA). Some authors have compared these models by observing differences that arise from fitting the models to real and simulated data. However, no attempt has been made to systematically identify the components of the models that are appropriate for recurrent event data. We propose a systematic way of characterizing such Cox-based models using four key components: risk intervals; baseline hazard; risk set, and correlation adjustment. From the definitions of risk interval and risk set there are conceptually seven such Cox-based models that are permissible, five of which are those previously identified. The two new variant models are termed the \u2018total time \u2013 restricted\u2019 (TT-R) and \u2018gap time \u2013 unrestricted\u2019 (GT-UR) models. The aim of the paper is to determine which models are appropriate for recurrent event data using the key components. The models are fitted to simulated data sets and to a data set of childhood recurrent infectious diseases. The LWA model is not appropriate for recurrent event data because it allows a subject to be at risk several times for the same event. The WLW model overestimates treatment effect and is not recommended. We conclude that PWP-GT and TT-R are useful models for analysing recurrent event data, providing answers to slightly different research questions. Further, applying a robust variance to any of these models does not adequately account for within-subject correlation. Copyright \u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Compared to other human diseases such as cancer, studies on VOC analysis in cases of infectious diseases are limited. Here, we have described results of studies which have used some of the appropriate technologies to evaluate VOC biomarkers and biomarker profiles associated with infections. The publications reviewed include important infections of the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and nasal cavity. The results highlight the use of VOC biomarker profiles resulting from certain infectious diseases in discriminating between infected and healthy subjects. Infection-related VOC profiles measured in exhaled breath as well as from headspaces of feces or urine samples are a source of information with respect to disease detection. The volatiles emitted in clinical matrices may on the one hand represent metabolites of the infecting pathogen or on the other hand reflect pathogen-induced host responses or, indeed, a combination of both. Because exhaled-breath samples are easy to collect and online instruments are commercially available, VOC analysis in exhaled breath appears to be a promising tool for noninvasive detection and monitoring of infectious diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "Many behavioral phenomena have been found to spread interpersonally through social networks, in a manner similar to infectious diseases. An important difference between social contagion and traditional infectious diseases, however, is that behavioral phenomena can be acquired by non-social mechanisms as well as through social transmission. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for studying these phenomena (the SISa model) by adapting a classic disease model to include the possibility for 'automatic' (or 'spontaneous') non-social infection. We provide an example of the use of this framework by examining the spread of obesity in the Framingham Heart Study Network. The interaction assumptions of the model are validated using longitudinal network transmission data. We find that the current rate of becoming obese is 2 per year and increases by 0.5 percentage points for each obese social contact. The rate of recovering from obesity is 4 per year, and does not depend on the number of non-obese contacts. The model predicts a long-term obesity prevalence of approximately 42, and can be used to evaluate the effect of different interventions on steady-state obesity. Model predictions quantitatively reproduce the actual historical time course for the prevalence of obesity. We find that since the 1970s, the rate of recovery from obesity has remained relatively constant, while the rates of both spontaneous infection and transmission have steadily increased over time. This suggests that the obesity epidemic may be driven by increasing rates of becoming obese, both spontaneously and transmissively, rather than by decreasing rates of losing weight. A key feature of the SISa model is its ability to characterize the relative importance of social transmission by quantitatively comparing rates of spontaneous versus contagious infection. It provides a theoretical framework for studying the interpersonal spread of any state that may also arise spontaneously, such as emotions, behaviors, health states, ideas or diseases with reservoirs.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract Declines in immune function are well described in the elderly and are considered to contribute significantly to the disease burden in this population. Regulatory T cells (Tregs), a CD4+ T cell subset usually characterized by high CD25 expression, control the intensity of immune responses both in rodents and humans. However, because CD25 expression does not define all Tregs, especially in aged hosts, we characterized Tregs by the expression of FOXP3, a transcription factor crucial for Treg differentiation and function. The proportion of FOXP3+CD4+ Tregs increased in the blood of the elderly and the lymphoid tissues of aged mice. The expression of functional markers, such as CTLA-4 and GITR, was either preserved or increased on FOXP3+ Tregs from aged hosts, depending on the tissue analyzed. In vitro depletion of peripheral Tregs from elderly humans improves effector T cell responses in most subjects. Importantly, Tregs from old FoxP3-GFP knock-in mice were suppressive, exhibiting a higher level of suppression per cell than young Tregs. The increased proportion of Tregs in aged mice was associated with the spontaneous reactivation of chronic Leishmania major infection in old mice, likely because old Tregs efficiently suppressed the production of IFN-\u03b3 by effector T cells. Finally, in vivo depletion of Tregs in old mice attenuated disease severity. Accumulation of functional Tregs in aged hosts could therefore play an important role in the frequent reactivation of chronic infections that occurs in aging. Manipulation of Treg numbers and/or activity may be envisioned to enhance the control of infectious diseases in this fragile population.",

    "abstract_text": "Macaques have served as models for more than 70 human infectious diseases of diverse etiologies, including a multitude of agents\u2014bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, prions. The remarkable diversity of human infectious diseases that have been modeled in the macaque includes global, childhood, and tropical diseases as well as newly emergent, sexually transmitted, oncogenic, degenerative neurologic, potential bioterrorism, and miscellaneous other diseases. Historically, macaques played a major role in establishing the etiology of yellow fever, polio, and prion diseases. With rare exceptions (Chagas disease, bartonellosis), all of the infectious diseases in this review are of Old World origin. Perhaps most surprising is the large number of tropical (16), newly emergent (7), and bioterrorism diseases (9) that have been modeled in macaques. Many of these human diseases (e.g., AIDS, hepatitis E, bartonellosis) are a consequence of zoonotic infection. However, infectious agents of certain diseases, including measles and tuberculosis, can sometimes go both ways, and thus several human pathogens are threats to nonhuman primates including macaques. Through experimental studies in macaques, researchers have gained insight into pathogenic mechanisms and novel treatment and vaccine approaches for many human infectious diseases, most notably acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Other infectious agents for which macaques have been a uniquely valuable resource for biomedical research, and particularly vaccinology, include influenza virus, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, arenaviruses, hepatitis E virus, papillomavirus, smallpox virus, Mycobacteria, Bacillus anthracis, Helicobacter pylori, Yersinia pestis, and Plasmodium species. This review summarizes the extensive past and present research on macaque models of human infectious disease.",

Our experimental findings are confirmed in natural pathogen populations\u2014more devastating epidemics were measured in populations with higher levels of co-infection.

The methods investigated yielded similar results with respect to identifying influential parameters, but offered specific insights that vary by method. The classical methods differed in their ability to provide information on the quantitative relationship between parameters and model output, particularly over time. The heat map approach provides information about the group sensitivity of all model state variables, and the parameter sensitivity spectrum obtained using this method reveals the sensitivity of all state variables to each parameter over the course of the simulation period, especially valuable for expressing the dynamic sensitivity of a microparasite epidemic model to its parameters.

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY Damp buildings often have a moldy smell or obvious mold growth; some molds are human pathogens. This has caused concern regarding health effects of moldy indoor environments and has resulted in many studies of moisture- and mold-damaged buildings. Recently, there have been reports of severe illness as a result of indoor mold exposure, particularly due to Stachybotrys chartarum. While many authors describe a direct relationship between fungal contamination and illness, close examination of the literature reveals a confusing picture. Here, we review the evidence regarding indoor mold exposure and mycotoxicosis, with an emphasis on S. chartarum. We also examine possible end-organ effects, including pulmonary, immunologic, neurologic, and oncologic disorders. We discuss the Cleveland infant idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage reports in detail, since they provided important impetus for concerns about Stachybotrys. Some valid concerns exist regarding the relationship between indoor mold exposure and human disease. Review of the literature reveals certain fungus-disease associations in humans, including ergotism (Claviceps species), alimentary toxic aleukia (Fusarium), and liver disease (Aspergillys). While many papers suggest a similar relationship between Stachybotrys and human disease, the studies nearly uniformly suffer from significant methodological flaws, making their findings inconclusive. As a result, we have not found well-substantiated supportive evidence of serious illness due to Stachybotrys exposure in the contemporary environment. To address issues of indoor mold-related illness, there is an urgent need for studies using objective markers of illness, relevant animal models, proper epidemiologic techniques, and examination of confounding factors.",

Thousands of these molecules have been discovered to date and multiple miRNAs have been shown to coordinately fine-tune cellular processes key to organismal development, homeostasis, neurobiology, immunobiology and control of infection. The fundamental regulatory role of miRNAs in a variety of biological processes suggests that differential expression of these transcripts may be exploited as a novel source of molecular biomarkers for many different disease pathologies or abnormalities. This has been emphasized by the recent discovery of remarkably stable miRNAs in mammalian biofluids, which may originate from intracellular processes elsewhere in the body. The potential of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers of disease has mainly been demonstrated for various types of cancer. More recently, however, attention has focused on the use of circulating miRNAs as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers of infectious disease; for example: human tuberculosis caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, sepsis caused by multiple infectious agents, and viral hepatitis. Here we review these developments and discuss prospects and challenges for translating circulating miRNA into novel diagnostics for infectious disease.",

The Korea Center for Disease Control (KCDC) operates a surveillance system to minimize infectious disease contagions. However, in this system, it is difficult to immediately act against infectious disease because of missing and delayed reports. Moreover, infectious disease trends are not known, which means prediction is not easy. This study predicts infectious diseases by optimizing the parameters of deep learning algorithms while considering big data including social media data. The performance of the deep neural network (DNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) learning models were compared with the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) when predicting three infectious diseases one week into the future. The results show that the DNN and LSTM models perform better than ARIMA. When predicting chickenpox, the top-10 DNN and LSTM models improved average performance by 24% and 19%, respectively. The DNN model performed stably and the LSTM model was more accurate when infectious disease was spreading. We believe that this study's models can help eliminate reporting delays in existing surveillance systems and, therefore, minimize costs to society.",

Hospitalization rates were calculated overall for IDs and for specific ID groups.An estimated 40,085,978 (standard error, 255,418) hospitalizations with a first-listed ID occurred during 1998-2006, for an age-adjusted hospitalization rate of 154.4 (95% confidence interval, 153.3-155.5) hospitalizations per 10,000 persons. The rate increased slightly over the study period (152.5 [95% confidence interval, 149.6-155.4] in 1998 vs 162.2 [95% confidence interval, 158.7-165.5] in 2006); an increase was seen for both sexes, for older patients, and for Hispanic patients. Among those aged 5-39 years, female patients had a significantly higher hospitalization rate than did male patients; male patients had higher rates among the youngest children and adults aged > or = 40 years. Approximately 4.5 million hospital days and $865 billion in hospital charges were associated with primary ID hospitalizations over the study period. Lower respiratory tract infections were the most commonly listed ID (34.4%), followed by kidney, urinary tract, and bladder infections; cellulitis; and abdominal and rectal infections.The ID hospitalization rate increased during 1998-2006, reflecting an increase in ID hospitalizations among adults aged > or = 30 years, particularly older adults. Differences in trends and patterns of ID hospitalizations were noted by sex, age group, and race. Lower respiratory tract infections accounted for the largest proportion of ID hospitalizations.

It is therefore not surprising that infectious disease researchers are increasingly taking a landscape genetics perspective to elucidate mechanisms underlying basic ecological processes driving infectious disease dynamics and to understand the linkage between spatially dependent population processes and the geographic distribution of genetic variation within both hosts and parasites. The increasing availability of genetic information on hosts and parasites when coupled to their ecological interactions can lead to insights for predicting patterns of disease emergence, spread and control. Here, we review research progress in this area based on four different motivations for the application of landscape genetics approaches: (i) assessing the spatial organization of genetic variation in parasites as a function of environmental variability, (ii) using host population genetic structure as a means to parameterize ecological dynamics that indirectly influence parasite populations, for example, gene flow and movement pathways across heterogeneous landscapes and the concurrent transport of infectious agents, (iii) elucidating the temporal and spatial scales of disease processes and (iv) reconstructing and understanding infectious disease invasion. Throughout this review, we emphasize that landscape genetic principles are relevant to infection dynamics across a range of scales from within host dynamics to global geographic patterns and that they can also be applied to unconventional 'landscapes' such as heterogeneous contact networks underlying the spread of human and livestock diseases. We conclude by discussing some general considerations and problems for inferring epidemiological processes from genetic data and try to identify possible future directions and applications for this rapidly expanding field.",

Following this, they and others performed many studies of infection by bioluminescent Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Viruses can also be engineered to encode luciferase. Our laboratory has used bioluminescent reporter viruses to follow HSV and vaccinia pathogenesis; others have used an alphavirus or novirhabdovirus. Recently, even eukaryotic parasites Plasmodium, Leishmania and Toxoplasma have been transformed with luciferase and yielded unique insights into their in vivo behaviour. We expect that both the range of organisms and the molecular events able to be studied by BLI will continue to expand, yielding important insights into mechanisms of pathogenesis.",

    "abstract_text": "Contact rates and patterns among individuals in a geographic area drive transmission of directly-transmitted pathogens, making it essential to understand and estimate contacts for simulation of disease dynamics. Under the uniform mixing assumption, one of two mechanisms is typically used to describe the relation between contact rate and population density: density-dependent or frequency-dependent. Based on existing evidence of population threshold and human mobility patterns, we formulated a spatial contact model to describe the appropriate form of transmission with initial growth at low density and saturation at higher density. We show that the two mechanisms are extreme cases that do not capture real population movement across all scales. Empirical data of human and wildlife diseases indicate that a nonlinear function may work better when looking at the full spectrum of densities. This estimation can be applied to large areas with population mixing in general activities. For crowds with unusually large densities (e.g., transportation terminals, stadiums, or mass gatherings), the lack of organized social contact structure deviates the physical contacts towards a special case of the spatial contact model \u2013 the dynamics of kinetic gas molecule collision. In this case, an ideal gas model with van der Waals correction fits well; existing movement observation data and the contact rate between individuals is estimated using kinetic theory. A complete picture of contact rate scaling with population density may help clarify the definition of transmission rates in heterogeneous, large-scale spatial systems.",

We generated protein microarrays by printing microbial antigens to simultaneously determine in human sera antibodies directed against Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 (ToRCH antigens). Methods: The antigens were printed on activated glass slides with high-speed robotics. The slides were incubated first with serum samples and subsequently with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. Human IgG and IgM bound to the printed antigens were detected by confocal scanning microscopy and quantified with internal calibration curves. Both microarrays and commercial ELISAs were utilized to detect serum antibodies against the ToRCH antigens in a panel of characterized human sera. Results: The detection limit (mean + 2 SD) of the microarray assay was 0.5 pg of IgG or IgM bound to the slides. Within-slide, between-slide, and between-batch precision profiles showed CVs of 1.7\u201318% for all antigens. Overall, &amp;gt;80% concordance was obtained between microarray assays and ELISAs in the classification of sera; for T. gondii, CMV, and HSV1, concordance exceeded 90%. Conclusions: The microarray is a suitable assay format for the serodiagnosis of infectious diseases and can be easily optimized for clinical use. The ToRCH assay performs equivalently to ELISA and may have potentially important advantages in throughput, convenience, and cost.",

Moreover, Th17 cells have been extensively analyzed because of their strong association with inflammatory disorders and autoimmune diseases. Also, they appear to be critical for controlling these disorders. Similar to Th1 and Th2 cells, Th17 cells require specific cytokines and transcription factors for their differentiation. Th17 cells have been characterized as one of the major pathogenic Th cell populations underlying the development of many autoimmune diseases, and they are enhanced and stabilized by IL-23.

This fourth edition of the guidelines, made available on the Internet in 2001, is intended for clinicians and other health-care providers who care for HIV-infected persons. The goal of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based guidelines for preventing OIs among HIV-infected adults and adolescents, including pregnant women, and HIV-exposed or infected children. Nineteen OIs, or groups of OIs, are addressed, and recommendations are included for preventing exposure to opportunistic pathogens, preventing first episodes of disease by chemoprophylaxis or vaccination (primary prophylaxis), and preventing disease recurrence [secondary prophylaxis]. Major changes since the last edition of the guidelines include 1) updated recommendations for discontinuing primary and secondary OI prophylaxis among persons whose CD4+ T lymphocyte counts have increased in response to antiretroviral therapy; 2) emphasis on screening all HIV-infected persons for infection with hepatitis C virus; 3) new information regarding transmission of human herpesvirus 8 infection; 4) new information regarding drug interactions, chiefly related to rifamycins and antiretroviral drugs; and 5) revised recommendations for immunizing HIV-infected adults and adolescents and HIV-exposed or infected children.",

Although there is keen interest in eradicating malaria, we do not yet have the necessary tools to meet this challenge, including an effective malaria vaccine and adequate vector control strategies.

Widely accepted general explanations for the persistence of such poverty have been elusive and are needed by the international development community. Building on a well-established model of human infectious diseases, we show how formally integrating simple economic and disease ecology models can naturally give rise to poverty traps, where initial economic and epidemiological conditions determine the long-term trajectory of the health and economic development of a society. This poverty trap may therefore be broken by improving health conditions of the population. More generally, we demonstrate that simple human ecological models can help explain broad patterns of modern economic organization.",

    "abstract_text": "It has long been known that cholera outbreaks can be initiated when Vibrio cholerae , the bacterium that causes cholera, is present in drinking water in sufficient numbers to constitute an infective dose, if ingested by humans. Outbreaks associated with drinking or bathing in unpurified river or brackish water may directly or indirectly depend on such conditions as water temperature, nutrient concentration, and plankton production that may be favorable for growth and reproduction of the bacterium. Although these environmental parameters have routinely been measured by using water samples collected aboard research ships, the available data sets are sparse and infrequent. Furthermore, shipboard data acquisition is both expensive and time-consuming. Interpolation to regional scales can also be problematic. Although the bacterium, V. cholerae , cannot be sensed directly, remotely sensed data can be used to infer its presence. In the study reported here, satellite data were used to monitor the timing and spread of cholera. Public domain remote sensing data for the Bay of Bengal were compared directly with cholera case data collected in Bangladesh from 1992\u20131995. The remote sensing data included sea surface temperature and sea surface height. It was discovered that sea surface temperature shows an annual cycle similar to the cholera case data. Sea surface height may be an indicator of incursion of plankton-laden water inland, e.g., tidal rivers, because it was also found to be correlated with cholera outbreaks. The extensive studies accomplished during the past 25 years, confirming the hypothesis that V. cholerae is autochthonous to the aquatic environment and is a commensal of zooplankton, i.e., copepods, when combined with the findings of the satellite data analyses, provide strong evidence that cholera epidemics are climate-linked.",

    "abstract_text": "There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that infectious disease may influence the species composition of natural communities. We examine the effect of a shared infectious disease on species coexistence in a differential equation model that generalizes to two host species, a one-host one-disease model explored by Anderson and May (1979). In the Anderson-May model, the transmission rate is described by a \"mass action\" term; there is no acquired immunity; and the infectious disease is the only factor regulating population growth. These assumptions, which are generally more applicable to invertebrate than to vertebrate hosts, are carried over to our two-host model. We show that, just as in the familiar Lotka-Volterra model of direct competition, there are three possible outcomes to the interaction: (1) one host species may unilaterally exclude the other; (2) the two host species may coexist; or (3) either host may exclude the other, with the outcome depending on initial conditions. These outcomes are graphically expressed with isoclines similar to those generated by the Lotka-Volterra model, and the necessary and sufficient condition for species coexistence is given by an expression formally parallel to the coexistence criterion of the Lotka-Volterra model. The numbers of infected individuals sustained by a host species when alone and at equilibrium are shown to be comparable to carrying capacity in the Lotka-Volterra model. Similarly, we show that the ratio of between-species to within-species infection rates is analogous to the competition coefficient. The model identifies three ingredients that must be assessed to predict the consequences of shared infectious disease for species coexistence: the intrinsic capacity for increase of each host; the per capita birth, death, and recovery rates of infected individuals; and the pattern of within- and cross-species infections. The model also leads to two additional conclusions that appear to apply in a broader range of models. First, given certain assumptions, including the assumption that infectious disease is the only factor regulating population growth, at equilibrium the ratio of infected to uninfected individuals in any particular host species is independent of the presence or absence of alternative host species. Second, the basic model does not lead to stable coexistence for an infectious disease that is only transmitted between host species and not within host species (i.e., host-parasite systems involving alternate hosts, such as infectious diseases carried between definitive hosts by intermediate hosts). The paper concludes with some suggestions about how this model can be extended to a broader class of infectious disease systems.",

Pathogen molecules may be disseminated by incorporation into vesicles that are created and shed by host cells, or they may be incorporated into vesicles shed from microbial cells. Involvement of ExMVs in the induction of immunity and host defense is widespread among many pathogens, whereas their involvement in immune evasion mechanisms is prominent among pathogens that establish chronic infection and is found in some that cause acute infection. Because of their immunogenicity and enrichment of pathogen molecules, exosomes may also have potential in vaccine preparations and as diagnostic markers. Additionally, the ability of exosomes to deliver molecules to recipient cells raises the possibility of their use for drug/therapy delivery. Thus, ExMVs play a major role in the pathogenesis of infection and provide exciting potential for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract_text": "The emergence of several high profile infectious diseases in recent years has focused attention on our need to understand the ecological factors contributing to the spread of infectious diseases. West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease that was first detected in the United States in 1999. The factors accounting for variation in the prevalence of WNV are poorly understood, but recent ideas suggesting links between high biodiversity and reduced vector-borne disease risk may help account for distribution patterns of this disease. Since wild birds are the primary reservoir hosts for WNV, we tested associations between passerine (Passeriform) bird diversity, non-passerine (all other orders) bird diversity and virus infection rates in mosquitoes and humans to examine the extent to which bird diversity is associated with WNV infection risk. We found that non-passerine species richness (number of non-passerine species) was significantly negatively correlated with both mosquito and human infection rates, whereas there was no significant association between passerine species richness and any measure of infection risk. Our findings suggest that non-passerine diversity may play a role in dampening WNV amplification rates in mosquitoes, minimizing human disease risk.",

    "title": "Human Mobility and the Global Spread of Infectious Diseases: A Focus on Air Travel",
    "abstract_text": "The volume of global air travel continues to increase annually, and passengers have the capacity to introduce infections to new regions in short time frames. Infections transported through air travel may initiate or facilitate epidemics. Front-line healthcare providers and public health teams require training and tools to properly identify and respond to infectious diseases transported through air travel, some of which may have epidemic potential. Developing more effective global surveillance tools and mechanisms to better communicate and coordinate between countries can facilitate more rapid and effective responses to epidemics. Greater human mobility, largely driven by air travel, is leading to an increase in the frequency and reach of infectious disease epidemics. Air travel can rapidly connect any two points on the planet, and this has the potential to cause swift and broad dissemination of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that may pose a threat to global health security. Investments to strengthen surveillance, build robust early-warning systems, improve predictive models, and coordinate public health responses may help to prevent, detect, and respond to new infectious disease epidemics. Greater human mobility, largely driven by air travel, is leading to an increase in the frequency and reach of infectious disease epidemics. Air travel can rapidly connect any two points on the planet, and this has the potential to cause swift and broad dissemination of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that may pose a threat to global health security. Investments to strengthen surveillance, build robust early-warning systems, improve predictive models, and coordinate public health responses may help to prevent, detect, and respond to new infectious disease epidemics. Increases in the global mobility of humans, nonhuman animals, plants, and products are driving the introduction of infectious diseases to new locations. In recent years we have witnessed several infectious diseases spread well beyond their previously understood geographic boundaries, as was demonstrated by the introduction of Zika virus to the Americas. We have also witnessed the emergence and spread of novel pathogens, such as the discovery of a previously unknown Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia spreading to distant countries such as South Korea [1Tatem A.J. et al.Global transport networks and infectious disease spread.Adv. Parasitol. 2006; 62: 293-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar]. Many factors contribute to the global spread of infectious diseases, including the increasing speed and reach of human mobility, increasing volumes of trade and tourism, and changing geographic distributions of disease vectors. In particular, human travel and migration (especially via air travel) is now a major driving force pushing infections into previously nonendemic settings. Year by year, there are increasing numbers of international tourists [2UN World Tourism Organization UNWTO Tourism Highlights.2017 edition. United Nations, 2017Google Scholar], more international refugees and migrants [3United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division International Migration Report 2017: Highlights. United Nations, 2017Google Scholar], greater capacity for shipping by sea [4Institute of Shipping Economics and Logistics (2017) World Seaborne Trade and World Port Traffic. Shipping Statistics and Market Review 61Google Scholar], and greater international air travel passenger volumes [5International Air Transport Association IATA Annual Review 2017. IATA, 2017Google Scholar]. Air travel poses a growing threat to global health security, as it is now possible for a traveler harboring an infection in one location on earth to travel to virtually any other point on the planet in only 1\u20132 days. Infections introduced via travel may be sporadic and have little potential for further transmission, such as Lassa fever introduced into European settings [6Haas W.H. et al.Imported Lassa fever in Germany: surveillance and management of contact persons.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2003; 36: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar]. In other situations, infections introduced by air travel may cause self-limited local epidemics such as Chikungunya virus in Italy [7Angelini R. et al.An outbreak of chikungunya fever in the province of Ravenna, Italy.Euro Surveill. 2007; 12: 12-14Google Scholar]. More recently, there are a growing number of examples of infections introduced to a new region that ultimately become endemic, such as Chikungunya virus in Latin America and the Caribbean [8Khan K. et al.Assessing the origin of and potential for international spread of chikungunya virus from the Caribbean.PLoS Curr. 2014; 6: 1-11Google Scholar]. Vector-borne infections, including arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) present unique challenges as disease vectors such as mosquitoes can be carried overland, in boats, or on planes, and may travel between any two points on the globe within their lifespan. Such vectors have the potential to infect nontravelers in their new destination, as is seen in airport malaria [6Haas W.H. et al.Imported Lassa fever in Germany: surveillance and management of contact persons.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2003; 36: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar]. Even if a vector is not infected, that vector may become endemic to a new region if there are suitable environmental conditions, and then potentially enable future epidemics. The most well-known example of this is the now-global distribution of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, the vectors responsible for a number of arbovirus infections including dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika viruses [9Kraemer M.U.G. et al.The global distribution of the arbovirus vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus.eLife. 2015; 4e08347Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar]. Vector introduction is further facilitated by ecological factors, such as climate change and urbanization, that may enable vectors to flourish in new regions. Clinical and public health care providers must be aware of the fluid boundaries of infectious diseases and be cognizant of the potential for imported infections. Front-line healthcare providers must now have knowledge of an increasingly broad spectrum of emerging illnesses from around the world, and public health teams must be prepared to respond to individual cases that have epidemic potential (e.g., Ebola virus), and coordinate responses at local, national, and international levels. Preparation for planning mass gatherings, such as large sporting events or an annual religious pilgrimage, require special consideration for the potential of these events to contribute to global outbreaks. Here, we outline emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that are spread via human mobility, with a focus on air travel. We discuss sporadic cases and localized epidemics, international epidemics, and then focus on clinical and public health implications. Travel-related illnesses are common and mostly mild and self-limited, such as traveler's diarrhea. However, the list of infections imported by returned travelers is growing [10Leder K. et al.GeoSentinel surveillance of illness in returned travelers, 2007\u20132011.Ann. Intern. Med. 2013; 158: 456-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar], and many are capable of causing local epidemics (Table 1).Table 1Recent Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases of Global Health Significance, Whose Spread Was Facilitated by Air TravelDiseaseOrigin (Year)DestinationInfluenza H1N1Mexico (2009) 48Mena I. et al.Origins of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in swine in Mexico.eLife. 2016; 5e16777Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google ScholarPandemic 50Simonsen L. et al.Global mortality estimates for the 2009 influenza pandemic from the GLaMOR project: a modeling study.PLoS Med. 2013; 10e1001558Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google ScholarVibrio choleraeSouth Asia (2002, 2008)Haiti epidemic (2010) 117Chin C.-S. et al.The origin of the Haitian cholera outbreak strain.N.

This protozoal vector-borne infection is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes that are found in many tropical and temperate countries [11Sinka M.E. et al.A global map of dominant malaria vectors.Parasit. Vectors. 2012; 5: 69Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar]. Malaria is a common cause of febrile illness in returned travelers [12Boggild A.K. et al.Travel-acquired infections and illnesses in Canadians: surveillance report from CanTravNet surveillance data, 2009-2011.Open Med. 2014; 8: e20-e32PubMed Google Scholar], and delays in diagnosis may lead to poor patient outcomes, including death [13McCarthy A.E. et al.Severe malaria in Canada, 2001\u20132013.Malar. J. 2015; 14: 151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. The incubation period varies from weeks to more than a month depending on the species, which frequently contributes to the delayed diagnosis of imported cases. Airport malaria, where non-travelers near airports are infected by mosquitoes that have been imported by air travel [14Isa\u00e4cson M. Airport malaria: a review.Bull. World Health Organ. 1989; 67: 737-743PubMed Google Scholar], is a challenging diagnosis as local clinicians may not suspect this infection. Although the spraying of arriving planes has reduced the incidence of cases, it continues to be a concern as volumes of travel continue to increase [15Tatem A.J. et al.Estimating the malaria risk of African mosquito movement by air travel.Malar. J. 2006; 5: 57Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar] and case reports of malaria in non-travelers continue to grow [16Pomares-Estran C. et al.Atypical aetiology of a conjugal fever: autochthonous airport malaria between Paris and French Riviera: a case report.Malar. J. 2009; 8: 202Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. Regions that have eradicated malaria but still have Anopheles vectors present are at risk of malaria reintroduction, for example in Sri Lanka [17Wickremasinghe A.R. et al.Should chemoprophylaxis be a main strategy for preventing re-introduction of malaria in highly receptive areas? Sri Lanka a case in point.Malar. J. 2017; 16: 102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. The global distribution of drug-resistant malaria is also changing, and strains of multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum appear to be spreading [18Imwong M. et al.Spread of a single multidrug resistant malaria parasite lineage (PfPailin) to Vietnam.Lancet Infect. Dis. 2017; 17: 1022-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar]. Although multidrug-resistant strains are still generally rare, there is growing concern that such strains may expand beyond their current boundaries through boat and air travel, heightening the need for better surveillance. Chronic infection with schistosomiasis is associated with gastrointestinal or urogenital pathology [19Ouma J.H. et al.Morbidity in schistosomiasis: an update.Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 117-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar]. Schistosomiasis is acquired via contact with contaminated fresh water and requires specific snail intermediate hosts for disease transmission [19Ouma J.H. et al.Morbidity in schistosomiasis: an update.Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 117-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar]. Locally acquired cases of schistosomiasis were discovered recently in France, and these were most certainly introduced by travelers from endemic settings in Africa [20Ramalli L. et al.Persistence of schistosomal transmission linked to the Cavu river in southern Corsica since 2013.Euro Surveill. 2018; (Published online 25 January 2018)https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.4.18-00017Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. Snails local to Corsica were found to be competent hosts of Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma bovis, and hybrids of the two infections. There is the potential for further disease expansion given ongoing human travel and migration from schistosomiasis-endemic regions to nonendemic areas with the requisite intermediate snail hosts. Air travel has contributed to several epidemics of global health significance in recent years. Typically, an infected individual, either symptomatic or within an incubation period, flies to a distant location and introduces this infection to the local population. Below, we discuss major international epidemics relevant to air travel after 2000. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002\u20132003 is an example of an emerging infection causing several simultaneous epidemics in noncontiguous geographic regions. SARS is a respiratory tract infection caused by a zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and is thought to have arisen in horseshoe bats and subsequently transmitted to humans through civets as intermediate hosts [21Hu B. et al.Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13e1006698Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar]. The 2002 SARS epidemic originated in southern China and spread via air travel to 29 countries, causing local epidemics in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines [22Christian M.D. et al.Severe acute respiratory syndrome.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2004; 38: 1420-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar]. The global epidemic lasted about 8 months, with 8096 probable cases and 774 deaths for a case-fatality rate of 10% [22Christian M.D. et al.Severe acute respiratory syndrome.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2004; 38: 1420-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar]. SARS caused widespread panic and cost an estimated US$11 billion worldwide [23Saywell T. et al.The cost of SARS: $11 billion and rising.Dow Jones Far East. Econ. Rev. 2003; 166: 12-17Google Scholar]. Although the public health response was swift and ultimately effective, this epidemic highlighted the need for increased international cooperation in the era of rapid global transit. This epidemic spurred revisions to the International Health Regulations (IHR) and introduced the most significant changes since their adoption [24Fidler D.P. Gostin L.O. The new International Health Regulations: an historic development for international law and public health.J. Law Med. Ethics. 2006; 34 (4): 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar]. Another novel zoonotic respiratory coronavirus, MERS-CoV, originated in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [25de Groot R.J. et al.Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): announcement of the Coronavirus Study Group.J. Virol. 2013; 87: 7790-7792Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar]. Its reservoir is thought to be the dromedary camel. Similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV causes a respiratory infection, though with a higher case-fatality rate of about 35% [26Yang Y.-M. et al.Impact of comorbidity on fatality rate of patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. Since 2012, over 2000 cases have been detected in 27 countries. South Korea experienced the largest epidemic outside of Saudi Arabia, which was initiated by a single infected business traveler returning from that country. This one index case at a single hospital resulted in an additional 184 confirmed cases at 17 hospitals, and caused 33 deaths before the epidemic ended 2 months later [27Ki M. 2015 MERS outbreak in Korea: hospital-to-hospital transmission.Epidemiol. Health. 2015; 37e2015033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Infection risk appeared to be primarily through hospital-based contact and fomites rather than through household contacts [28Lee S.S. Wong N.S. Probable transmission chains of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the multiple generations of secondary infection in South Korea.Int. J. Infect. Dis. 2015; 38: 65-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar]. Although the virus is thought to have low epidemic potential, epidemics such as the one in South Korea are not unexpected [29Kucharski A.J. Althaus C.L. The role of superspreading in Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) transmission.Euro Surveill. 2015; 20: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar]. There are a number of countries at risk of importing cases via air travel due to close trade and tourism ties to Saudi Arabia [30Gardner L.M. et al.Risk of global spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) via the air transport network.J. Travel Med. 2016; 23: 1-8Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar]. Additionally, the annual Hajj pilgrimage brings millions of pilgrims from around the world to Saudi Arabia, raising the potential for future epidemics [31Zumla A. et al.Infectious diseases epidemic threats and mass gatherings: Refocusing global attention on the continuing spread of the Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).BMC Med. 2016; 14: 2012-2015Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. The 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa also highlighted the risks of global infectious disease transmission in an increasingly connected world. This zoonotic virus has a probable bat reservoir [32Leendertz S.A.J. et al.Assessing the evidence supporting fruit bats as the primary reservoirs for Ebola viruses.Ecohealth. 2016; 13: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar] and is spread between humans through contact with infected body fluids. EVD can incubate for up to 3 weeks before presenting as a severe febrile illness with multisystem organ failure and hemorrhagic tendencies. Epidemics have largely been confined to Africa, with case fatality rates between 30% to upwards of 80% [33Lefebvre A. et al.Case fatality rates of Ebola virus diseases: a meta-analysis of World Health Organization data.Med. Mal. Infect. 2014; 44: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar]. The largest EVD epidemic began in Sierra Leone in 2014. Starting in a rural town, the epidemic spread via land travel to bordering Guinea and Liberia. From there, cases began appearing on several continents via international air travel. In the USA, for instance, one returned traveler infected two healthcare workers before local transmission stopped [34Regan J.J. et al.Public health response to commercial airline travel of a person with Ebola virus infection \u2013 United States, 2014.MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 2015; 64: 63-66PubMed Google Scholar]. Similar imported cases were seen in Italy and the United Kingdom, and a short chain of healthcare-related transmission was documented following the return of an infected Spanish citizen back to Spain [35Bertoli G. et al.Ebola virus disease: Case management in the Institute of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Sassari, Sardinia, Italy.J. Infect. Dev. Ctries. 2016; 10: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 36L\u00f3paz M.A. et al.First secondary case of Ebola outside Africa: epidemiological characteristics and contact monitoring, Spain, September to November 2014.Euro Surveill. 2015; 20: 21003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. An infected individual flew to Nigeria and initiated a larger epidemic, with 19 confirmed cases in two cities resulting in seven deaths [37Shuaib F. et al.Ebola virus disease outbreak \u2013 Nigeria, July\u2013September 2014.MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 2014; 63: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar]. Ultimately, the Nigerian epidemic was halted by the heroic efforts of local public health teams [38Harris M. et al.It takes threat of Ebola to see lessons from low income countries.Global Health. 2015; 11: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. By the time the West African EVD outbreak ended in 2016, there were 21 868 reported cases and 11 310 deaths, with imported cases in seven countries. During the 2014 EVD epidemic, many countries hastily instituted policies that limited travel to and from EVD-affected countries. Some countries closed land and air borders with Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone [39Cohen N.J. Travel and border health measures to prevent the international spread of Ebola.MMWR. 2016; 65: 57-67Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 40BBC News (2014) Ivorian land border shut over Ebola. BBC News 23 August 2014Google Scholar], and others, including Australia and Canada, temporarily refused to issue visas to travelers from affected countries [41CBC News (2014) Canada won't issue visas to residents of Ebola outbreak countries. CBC News 21 October 2014Google Scholar], a policy not aligned with the World Health Organization (WHO)'s IHR. The USA imposed enhanced screening procedures that measured the temperature of returned travelers from affected countries for up to 3 weeks. The 2014 EVD epidemic highlighted how governments may rapidly impose policy related to an emerging infection of epidemic potential, although the effectiveness of many of these policies is still debated. Influenza A virus causes predictable seasonal epidemics in both northern and southern hemispheres. Influenza A virus also circulates in birds and pigs and has the potential to mutate more rapidly compared to influenza B virus, allowing the virus to recombine with different strains and cause epidemics. Many individuals infected with influenza A virus will experience a self-limited febrile illness punctuated with myalgia and malaise, and this infection is also associated with severe illness and is responsible for roughly 300 000\u2013600 000 deaths per year, globally [42Iuliano A.D. et al.Estimates of global seasonal influenza-associated respiratory mortality: a modelling study.Lancet. 2018; 391: 1285-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar]. The 1918 influenza pandemic demonstrated the ability of influenza A virus to cause a global catastrophe in the era of increasing global mobility, as it resulted in an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide [43Johnson N.P.A.S. Mueller J. Updating the accounts: global mortality of the 1918\u20131920 'Spanish' influenza pandemic.Bull. Hist. Med. 2002; 76: 105-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Seasonal influenza strains are now more mobile than ever, and the effect of air travel is a well-established mechanism for facilitating global influenza transmission [44Grais R.F. et al.Modeling the spread of annual influenza epidemics in the U.S.: the potential role of air travel.Health Care Manag.

Epidemiol. 1994; 10: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar]. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic demonstrated the potential for global air travel networks to rapidly disseminate a novel influenza virus that emerged on a pig farm in Mexico and spread to the rest of the world [48Mena I. et al.Origins of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in swine in Mexico.eLife. 2016; 5e16777Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 49Khan K. et al.Spread of a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus via global airline transportation.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar], resulting in approximately 123 000\u2013203 000 deaths, globally [50Simonsen L. et al.Global mortality estimates for the 2009 influenza pandemic from the GLaMOR project: a modeling study.PLoS Med. 2013; 10e1001558Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar]. Human mobility continues to introduce infections to new geographic locations, and air travel contributes to this process. Occasionally, infections introduced to new regions may become endemic. The global emergence of arboviruses, such as dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya viruses, demonstrates how certain infections may become endemic in new regions if they are imported to areas with suitable ecological conditions. These arboviruses require Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus mosquito vectors for transmission, and at least one of these species of mosquito is now present on every continent except Antarctica [9Kraemer M.U.G. et al.The global distribution of the arbovirus vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus.eLife. 2015; 4e08347Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar]. Ae. albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is well adapted to urban environments [51Bonizzoni M. et al.The invasive mosquito species Aedes albopictus: current knowledge and future perspectives.Trends Parasitol. 2013; 29: 460-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar] and has contributed to recent arboviral epidemics.

We postulate that since systemic infection can provoke the enhanced synthesis of inflammatory mediators in the brain, such diseases may promote the onset of dementia. We carried out a nested case-control study using the General Practice Research Database. Cases were patients with incident dementia, and controls without such a diagnosis. Infectious episodes in the four years preceding diagnosis were counted using diagnostic codes, or prescription codes for anti-infective drugs. We considered age, sex, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and frequency of consultation as potential confounders. There were 9954 valid cases, and 9374 valid controls. Cases were on average older, more likely to be female, to smoke and to have diabetes, than the controls. There was an increased risk of diagnosis of dementia in those patients older than 84 with infections (OR for 2 or more infections compared with 0 or 1 = 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.7). Smoking and diabetes mellitus were also shown to markedly increase the risk of diagnosis of dementia. We have shown a positive association between episodes of infection and increased likelihood of diagnosis of dementia in the very elderly. Smoking and diabetes mellitus are associated with onset of dementia in the elderly. The evidence from this study may represent cause and effect, since there is a credible biologic explanation.",

We tested five key hypotheses regarding cultural change in individualism-collectivism. As predicted by previous theories, changes in socioeconomic structure, pathogen prevalence, and secularism accompanied changes in individualism averaged across all measures. The relationship with changes in individualism was less robust for urbanization. Contrary to previous theories, changes in individualism were positively (as opposed to negatively) related to the frequency of disasters. Time-lagged analyses suggested that only socioeconomic structure had a robust effect on individualism; changes in socioeconomic structure preceded changes in individualism.

These have reduced the effectiveness of several classes of antibiotics for treating infections in humans and livestock. Recent outbreaks of virulent strains of influenza have arisen from swine and poultry raised in close proximity. This working group, which was part of the Conference on Environmental Health Impacts of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations: Anticipating Hazards\u2014Searching for Solutions, considered the state of the science around these issues and concurred with the World Health Organization call for a phasing-out of the use of antimicrobial growth promotants for livestock and fish production. We also agree that all therapeutic antimicrobial agents should be available only by prescription for human and veterinary use. Concern about the risk of an influenza pandemic leads us to recommend that regulations be promulgated to restrict the co-location of swine and poultry concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) on the same site and to set appropriate separation distances.",

    "abstract_text": "A better characterization of the early growth dynamics of an epidemic is needed to dissect the important drivers of disease transmission, refine existing transmission models, and improve disease forecasts.We introduce a 2-parameter generalized-growth model to characterize the ascending phase of an outbreak and capture epidemic profiles ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth. We test the model against empirical outbreak data representing a variety of viral pathogens in historic and contemporary populations, and provide simulations highlighting the importance of sub-exponential growth for forecasting purposes.We applied the generalized-growth model to 20 infectious disease outbreaks representing a range of transmission routes. We uncovered epidemic profiles ranging from very slow growth (p=0.14 for the Ebola outbreak in Bomi, Liberia (2014)) to near exponential (p>0.9 for the smallpox outbreak in Khulna (1972), and the 1918 pandemic influenza in San Francisco). The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Uruguay displayed a profile of slower growth while the growth pattern of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Japan was approximately linear. The West African Ebola epidemic provided a unique opportunity to explore how growth profiles vary by geography; analysis of the largest district-level outbreaks revealed substantial growth variations (mean p=0.59, range: 0.14-0.97). The districts of Margibi in Liberia and Bombali and Bo in Sierra Leone had near-exponential growth, while the districts of Bomi in Liberia and Kenema in Sierra Leone displayed near constant incidences.Our findings reveal significant variation in epidemic growth patterns across different infectious disease outbreaks and highlights that sub-exponential growth is a common phenomenon, especially for pathogens that are not airborne. Sub-exponential growth profiles may result from heterogeneity in contact structures or risk groups, reactive behavior changes, or the early onset of interventions strategies, and consideration of \"deceleration parameters\" may be useful to refine existing mathematical transmission models and improve disease forecasts.",

    "abstract_text": "Objective: To update the practice parameters for the evaluation of adult patients who develop a new fever in the intensive care unit, for the purpose of guiding clinical practice. Participants: A task force of 11 experts in the disciplines related to critical care medicine and infectious diseases was convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Specialties represented included critical care medicine, surgery, internal medicine, infectious diseases, neurology, and laboratory medicine/microbiology. Evidence: The task force members provided personal experience and determined the published literature (MEDLINE articles, textbooks, etc.) from which consensus was obtained. Published literature was reviewed and classified into one of four categories, according to study design and scientific value. Consensus Process: The task force met twice in person, several times by teleconference, and held multiple e-mail discussions during a 2-yr period to identify the pertinent literature and arrive at consensus recommendations. Consideration was given to the relationship between the weight of scientific evidence and the strength of the recommendation. Draft documents were composed and debated by the task force until consensus was reached by nominal group process. Conclusions: The panel concluded that, because fever can have many infectious and noninfectious etiologies, a new fever in a patient in the intensive care unit should trigger a careful clinical assessment rather than automatic orders for laboratory and radiologic tests. A cost-conscious approach to obtaining cultures and imaging studies should be undertaken if indicated after a clinical evaluation. The goal of such an approach is to determine, in a directed manner, whether infection is present so that additional testing can be avoided and therapeutic decisions can be made.",

This trend will continue because a number of factors, including the increased global population, aging, travel, urbanization, and climate change, favor the emergence, evolution, and spread of new pathogens. The approach used so far for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) does not work from the technical point of view, and it is not sustainable. However, the advent of platform technologies offers vaccine manufacturers an opportunity to develop new vaccines faster and to reduce the investment to build manufacturing facilities, in addition to allowing for the possible streamlining of regulatory processes. The new technologies also make possible the rapid development of human monoclonal antibodies that could become a potent immediate response to an emergency. So far, several proposals to approach EIDs have been made independently by scientists, the private sector, national governments, and international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO). While each of them has merit, there is a need for a global governance that is capable of taking a strong leadership role and making it attractive to all partners to come to the same table and to coordinate the global approach.",

    "abstract_text": "It is well accepted that infectious diseases have been among the dominant selective forces influencing human populations over the past 10,000 years (Haldane 1949, McNeill 1976). However, despite theoretical studies suggesting parasites may be involved both in the regulation of host abundance and the maintenance of host genetic diversity (Anderson and May 1978, May and Anderson 1978, Anderson 1979 and 1981, Hamilton 1982, O'Brien and Evermann 1988) our understanding of the impact of infectious diseases on wild animal populations remains poor. Although parasitism, by definition, is associated with morbidity and mortality of the host (Anderson and May 1978, Price 1980), the traditional belief has been that 'well-adapted' parasites do little harm to their hosts, so as to prevent their own eradication (Grundman et al. 1976, Price 1980). This view is now questioned, as theoretical studies indicate that many co-evolutionary pathways may be followed, depending upon the relationships between parasite pathogenicity and transmission efficiency (Anderson and May 1982, May and Anderson 1990, Dobson and Merenlender 1991, Toft and Aeschlimann 1991). Thus, although the literature abounds with reports of infectious disease agents causing mortality in individual wild animals, these cases have been interpreted as resulting from an 'imbalance' in the natural host-parasite interaction. Such 'imbalances' may result from the introduction of an infectious agent into a naive wildlife population by man, classically exemplified by avian malaria in Hawaii and rinderpest in Africa (Warner 1968, Van Riper et al. 1986, Plowright 1982), or by an alteration of the host's resistance to infection.",

    "abstract_text": "A myriad of new tools and algorithms have been developed to help public health professionals analyze and visualize the complex data used in infectious disease control. To better understand approaches to meet these users\u2019 information needs, we conducted a systematic literature review focused on the landscape of infectious disease visualization tools for public health professionals, with a special emphasis on geographic information systems (GIS), molecular epidemiology, and social network analysis. The objectives of this review are to: (1) identify public health user needs and preferences for infectious disease information visualization tools; (2) identify existing infectious disease information visualization tools and characterize their architecture and features; (3) identify commonalities among approaches applied to different data types; and (4) describe tool usability evaluation efforts and barriers to the adoption of such tools. We identified articles published in English from January 1, 1980 to June 30, 2013 from five bibliographic databases. Articles with a primary focus on infectious disease visualization tools, needs of public health users, or usability of information visualizations were included in the review. A total of 88 articles met our inclusion criteria. Users were found to have diverse needs, preferences and uses for infectious disease visualization tools, and the existing tools are correspondingly diverse. The architecture of the tools was inconsistently described, and few tools in the review discussed the incorporation of usability studies or plans for dissemination. Many studies identified concerns regarding data sharing, confidentiality and quality. Existing tools offer a range of features and functions that allow users to explore, analyze, and visualize their data, but the tools are often for siloed applications. Commonly cited barriers to widespread adoption included lack of organizational support, access issues, and misconceptions about tool use. As the volume and complexity of infectious disease data increases, public health professionals must synthesize highly disparate data to facilitate communication with the public and inform decisions regarding measures to protect the public\u2019s health. Our review identified several themes: consideration of users\u2019 needs, preferences, and computer literacy; integration of tools into routine workflow; complications associated with understanding and use of visualizations; and the role of user trust and organizational support in the adoption of these tools. Interoperability also emerged as a prominent theme, highlighting challenges associated with the increasingly collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of infectious disease control and prevention. Future work should address methods for representing uncertainty and missing data to avoid misleading users as well as strategies to minimize cognitive overload.",

Through a review of existing literature at the nexus of urbanisation and infectious disease, we consider how this (potential) increased vulnerability to infectious diseases in peri- or suburban areas is in fact dialectically related to socio-material transformations on the metropolitan edge. In particular, we highlight three key factors influencing the spread of infectious disease that have been identified in the literature: demographic change, infrastructure and governance. These have been chosen given both the prominence of these themes and their role in shaping the spread of disease on the urban edge. Further, we suggest how a landscape political ecology framework can be useful for examining the role of socio-ecological transformations in generating increased risk of infectious disease in peri- and suburban areas. To illustrate our arguments we will draw upon examples from various re-emerging infectious disease events and outbreaks around the world to reveal how extended urbanisation in the broadest sense has amplified the conditions necessary for the spread of infectious diseases. We thus call for future research on the spatialities of health and disease to pay attention to how variegated patterns of extended urbanisation may influence possible outbreaks and the mechanisms through which such risks can be alleviated.",

Studies were reviewed to describe methods used to evaluate timeliness and the reporting timeliness of National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) data was evaluated to determine if this system could support timely notification and state response to multistate outbreaks. Methods Published papers that quantitatively measured timeliness of infectious disease surveillance systems operating in the U.S. were reviewed. Median reporting timeliness lags were computed for selected nationally notifiable infectious diseases based on a state-assigned week number and various date types. The percentage of cases reported within the estimated incubation periods for each disease was also computed. Results Few studies have published quantitative measures of reporting timeliness; these studies do not evaluate timeliness in a standard manner. When timeliness of NNDSS data was evaluated, the median national reporting delay, based on date of disease onset, ranged from 12 days for meningococcal disease to 40 days for pertussis. Diseases with the longer incubation periods tended to have a higher percentage of cases reported within its incubation period. For acute hepatitis A virus infection, which had the longest incubation period of the diseases studied, more than 60% of cases were reported within one incubation period for each date type reported. For cryptosporidiosis, Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection, meningococcal disease, salmonellosis, and shigellosis, less than 40% of cases were reported within one incubation period for each reported date type. Conclusion Published evaluations of infectious disease surveillance reporting timeliness are few in number and are not comparable. A more standardized approach for evaluating and describing surveillance system timeliness should be considered; a recommended methodology is presented. Our analysis of NNDSS reporting timeliness indicated that among the conditions evaluated (except for acute hepatitis A infection), the long reporting lag and the variability across states limits the usefulness of NNDSS data and aberration detection analysis of those data for identification of and timely response to multistate outbreaks. Further evaluation of the factors that contribute to NNDSS reporting timeliness is warranted.",

Public involvement requires adequate information, but determinants such as health literacy can impact on the effective use of such knowledge. The influence of health literacy on infectious diseases is examined in this paper.MethodsDatabases were searched from January 1999 through July 2015 seeking studies reporting on health literacy and infections such tuberculosis, malaria, and influenza, and infection-related behaviours such as vaccination and hand hygiene. HIV was excluded, as comprehensive reviews have already been published.ResultsStudies were found on antibiotic knowledge and use, the adoption of influenza and MMR immunizations, and screening for sexually transmitted and viral hepatitis infections. There was a lack of investigations on areas such as tuberculosis, malaria, hand hygiene, and diarrhoeal diseases.ConclusionsLimited or insufficient health literacy was associated with reduced adoption of protective behaviours such as immunization, and an inadequate understanding of antibiotics, although the relationship was not consistent. Large gaps remain in relation to infectious diseases with a high clinical and societal impact, such as tuberculosis and malaria.",

To date, 6 clinical infections with vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) have been reported in the United States. Intermediate resistance appears to develop from preexisting strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in the presence of vancomycin, and all but 1 infection occurred in patients with exposure to dialysis for renal insufficiency. Detection of VISA is difficult in the laboratory, and special inquiries about susceptibility testing methods may be needed. These VISA-infected patients had underlying illnesses, and their infections did not appear to respond well to conventional treatment. Prevention strategies have been outlined. Without continued vigilance in enforcing infection-control measures, improved use of antimicrobials, and coordination of efforts among public health authorities, increasing levels of vancomycin resistance in S. aureus are likely to be encountered.",

The continuing epidemics of tuberculosis, HIV, malaria, and influenza, and the emergence of novel zoonotic pathogens represent major clinical management challenges worldwide. Newer approaches to improving treatment outcomes are needed to reduce the high morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases. Recent insights into pathogen-host interactions, pathogenesis, inflammatory pathways, and the host's innate and acquired immune responses are leading to identification and development of a wide range of host-directed therapies with different mechanisms of action. Host-directed therapeutic strategies are now becoming viable adjuncts to standard antimicrobial treatment. Host-directed therapies include commonly used drugs for non-communicable diseases with good safety profiles, immunomodulatory agents, biologics (eg monoclonal antibodies), nutritional products, and cellular therapy using the patient's own immune or bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells. We discuss clinically relevant examples of progress in identifying host-directed therapies as adjunct treatment options for bacterial, viral, and parasitic infectious diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "Repurposing existing drugs is an emerging strategy for expediting the approval of effective and safe therapeutics, such as for the treatment of orphan drug diseases. New indications for antiviral activity can be identified for molecules of different origins showing repurposing potential by acting against a previously known target or a new antiviral target. Innovative approaches for target validation (e.g., gene editing by CRISPR/Cas9) and new experimental models (e.g., organoids) allowed the identification of novel antiviral agents and the unraveling of molecular pathways underlying viral pathogenesis. Drug repurposing has successfully identified promising candidate drugs that can open new therapeutic avenues to counteract current viral pathogens and possible emerging viruses. Despite the recent advances in controlling some viral pathogens, most viral infections still lack specific treatment. Indeed, the need for effective therapeutic strategies to combat 'old', emergent, and re-emergent viruses is not paralleled by the approval of new antivirals. In the past years, drug repurposing combined with innovative approaches for drug validation, and with appropriate animal models, significantly contributed to the identification of new antiviral molecules and targets for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we describe the main strategies of drug repurposing in antiviral discovery, discuss the most promising candidates that could be repurposed to treat viral infections, and analyze the possible caveats of this trendy strategy of drug discovery.

In this review, we describe the main strategies of drug repurposing in antiviral discovery, discuss the most promising candidates that could be repurposed to treat viral infections, and analyze the possible caveats of this trendy strategy of drug discovery. The identification of new targets for chemotherapeutic intervention is often not paralleled by the development and licensing of new drugs. Antiviral agents for treating viral infectious diseases are not an exception. From 2012 to 2017, only 12 new antivirals have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA, of which 8 are for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related pathologies and 2 are combinations of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs (www.fda.gov). On the other hand, governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) have to deal with critical (re)emerging viruses, characterized by pandemic potential and responsible for alarming outbreaks in recent years, which still lack specific treatment, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A drug discovery approach that has recently become very popular is drug repurposing (DR), which consists of giving old drugs a new indication by exploring new molecular pathways and targets for intervention [1Jones L.H. Bunnage M.E. Applications of chemogenomic library screening in drug discovery.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2017; 16: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 2Strittmatter S.M. Overcoming drug development bottlenecks with repurposing: old drugs learn new tricks.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 590-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar]. DR applied to viral infectious diseases takes into account different strategies by integrating both screenings of bioactive small-molecule collections and computational methods (in silico screenings, mining of database with transcriptomic profiles, etc.) in order to find a molecule, a pathway, or a biological activity that could be recycled in fighting a viral pathogen. Beyond the unquestionable economic advantage derived from such an approach in the drug development process, repurposed drugs can quickly enter clinical trials or be employed for compassionate use, especially in the case of viral diseases lacking of specific treatment. Moreover, DR represents a constant source of new knowledge in virus biology as well as of molecules with previously undescribed antiviral properties that can be further used as molecular tools in uncovering molecular mechanisms of virus replication and pathogenesis. In many cases, DR points out previously unexplored cellular pathways, turning them into targets for new therapeutic strategies, even if the identified molecules cannot be introduced in clinical therapy. In this review, we describe the most meaningful results of this 'from bed to bench' approach, discuss the most promising drugs that could be repurposed to treat viral infections, and analyze the possible caveats of this trendy strategy of drug discovery, whose advantages and pitfalls are summarized in Table 1.Table 1Advantages and Pitfalls of a Drug Repurposing Approach for Antiviral Drug DiscoveryAdvantagesPitfallsLow cost and less time-consuming (essential for the development of drugs to treat neglected diseases)Target identification can be circuitous, and identified drugs may show polypharmacologyPossibility to skip preclinical trials (no animal studies) and to directly enter phase 2 clinical trialsDue to the high doses employed in the screenings, toxic drugs can be initially misidentified as activePotential for combination strategies with the possibility to delay or reduce resistance associated with monotherapyEffective concentrations are often higher than the plasma levels achievable in humansOften analogs (together with pharmacological information) are already available for testingMedicinal chemistry to design more potent analogs is not applicable without losing repurposing potentialAcademic/small laboratories can be determinant in the drug-discovery processIdentified drugs are often under intellectual property and/or programs that make them unavailable or unattractive for other pharmaceutical companies that could take over the further development and costs of clinical trialsFormulations and manufacturing chains are already established for the large-scale production (launching costs are avoided) Open table in a new tab Three different scenarios of antiviral DR can be identified depending on whether the repurposed molecule has previously known antiviral activity (Figure 1, Key Figure): (i) Same target \u2013 new virus. The first option is when an antiviral drug that is known to target a specific viral or cellular function/pathway is found to possess activity against other viruses. The antiviral activity relies on structural homology and common enzymatic features of the viral target or on shared pathways exploited for virus replication. Viral RNA polymerase inhibitors such as favipiravir and sofosbuvir (approved for the treatment of influenza virus and HCV infections, respectively) showed repurposing potential against EBOV and ZIKV (see below). Another example is represented by drugs (e.g., chloroquine) that interfere with the late-stage entry process of viruses, such as filoviruses and coronaviruses, which exploit cellular endocytic pathways to enter the host cell. (ii) Same target \u2013 new indication. This occurs when a pharmacological target (i.e., a protein or a pathway that can be modulated by an approved drug) is found to be essential in a pathogenic process associated with a viral infection. In this case, the approved drug can be exploited also as an antiviral therapeutic agent (new indication). The case is exemplified by the anticancer drug imatinib that inhibits cellular Abelson (ABL) kinase and was found to be also active against pathogenic coronaviruses [3Coleman C.M. et al.Abelson kinase inhibitors are potent inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus fusion.J. Virol. 2016; 90: 8924-8933Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar]. (iii) New target \u2013 new indication. This occurs when an approved drug with established bioactivity in a specific pathway or mechanism is found to have a new molecular target (i.e., it shows polypharmacology, see Glossary) which is essential for virus replication. Examples are antimicrobial agents (e.g., teicoplanin, ivermectin, itraconazole, and nitazoxanide) that were found to have a target also in virus-infected cells, whose inhibition has detrimental effects on viral replication [4Colson P. Raoult D. Fighting viruses with antibiotics: an overlooked path.Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2016; 48: 349-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5Strating J.R.P.M. et al.Itraconazole inhibits enterovirus replication by targeting the oxysterol-binding protein.Cell Rep. 2015; 10: 600-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar]. Drugs with repurposing potential against viral diseases have been identified mostly by the screening of small-molecule libraries consisting of drugs, both approved and developmental, and other compounds with known bioactivity, including compounds of natural origin. Most of these libraries are available at public institutions or commercially; however, a number of proprietary or in-house-made collections also exist, often consisting of only one class of drugs (e.g., kinase or apoptosis inhibitors, etc.) and can be useful for target deconvolution. Table 2 lists the drug collections most widely used in antiviral DR. In the past 5\u201310 years, partnerships between public and private institutions have been strongly encouraged by governments to expedite the identification of new candidate drugs, in particular for orphan diseases, and several pharmaceutical companies have opened their proprietary collections to collaboration programs with academic research groups [6Loregian A.

Open table in a new tab Despite the restricted number of available collections, and the fact that often the same drugs are present in various libraries, in several cases different outcomes for the same viral pathogen have been obtained. A possible explanation is the different experimental setup used, including differences in cell type, virus strain, dose, readout method, and so on. Conversely, by screening different libraries, the same drugs were independently identified in some cases (e.g., for MERS-CoV, see below). Finally, virtual screening of chemical structures can also be performed to find new potential antiviral drugs; however, this approach is dependent upon the availability of structural information and a priori knowledge of the target. It is not usually required in DR screenings aimed at the discovery of new antiviral drugs to validate a target before the screening; in fact, an ex-post target validation, and even identification, is possible once an active molecule has been identified. Thus, DR screenings can mainly undertake two different experimental approaches: (i) unknown target \u2013 phenotypic assay, or (ii) known target \u2212 mechanism-based assay. In the first case, the target is generally unknown, and a phenotypic assay is employed for the identification of hit compounds. Phenotypic assays are based on a readout that is synonymous with antiviral activity and can be easily monitored in a high-throughput format. For example, the protection of infected cell monolayers by virus-induced cytopathic effect or the detection of a late-expressed, structural viral protein (envelope protein in most cases) are the most frequently exploited. After hit identification by phenotypic assay, the next step is the identification and validation of the target (a protein, a pathway, etc., which sometimes can be deduced from the mechanism of action of the identified hit compound). The validation is required to demonstrate that the target is indeed essential for virus replication and/or pathogenesis and is subordinated to the demonstration that its modulation leads to protection from virus infection and inhibition of virus-associated pathogenic effects. Experimental approaches for antiviral target validation can be exemplified by genetic knockdown through RNA interference, gene editing by CRISPR/Cas9 system, mutational analysis, and the use of pharmacological inhibitors (if available). All of these can be evaluated in cultured cells, in organoids, in ex vivo experimental models, as well as in animal models. Finally, when possible, a clinical validation on patient-derived samples or data can also be performed. Indeed, when a routinely employed drug is found to be potentially effective in the treatment of a viral infection, a possible positive correlation between drug administration in target patients and inhibition of the viral infection can be retrospectively analyzed in clinical studies. Alternatively, in mechanism-based DR screenings, target validation is mandatory prior to the screening design. Most frequent targets are druggable viral or cellular enzymes or receptors. The experimental setup in mechanism-based assays is specifically designed to identify molecules able to interfere with a particular process previously identified as essential for productive virus replication or involved in viral pathogenesis. Assays based on a specific mechanism, that is, inhibition of a transcription factor, protection from apoptosis by interfering with a specific activating mechanism, or inhibition of virus entry, are the most popular approaches in DR screenings. Cell-free systems and in vitro assays with purified proteins can be used; however, cellular assays with engineered cell lines, recombinant viruses and/or replicon systems, or pseudoviruses, are preferred as information on target modulation is obtained directly in a physiological environment. Compounds identified by mechanism-based assays in DR screenings against ZIKV, EBOV, and DNA viruses are described below. Although DR screenings based on mechanism-based assays could be more convenient (because the target is known), sometimes false positives can be identified. Other limits are the possible toxicity of the hits due to off-target effects and missing antiviral compounds acting by different mechanisms because the antiviral activity is restricted to a single process established a priori. In the following sections we describe the most recent advances of repurposing of existing and candidate drugs to treat infections caused by both RNA and DNA viruses (Table 3). Priority has been given to drugs that showed efficacy in clinical trials, or in animal models, and to investigational drugs exhibiting effective concentrations compatible with clinically achievable plasma levels in humans.Table 3Approved and Candidate Drugs with Repurposing Potential as Antiviral AgentsCompoundStatus/indicationVirusExperimental modelaThe most advanced phase of drug development is reported.TargetRefsMycophenolic acidApproved/immunomodulatorZIKVInfected cells in vitroNDbND: not determined.8Barrows N.J. et al.A screen of FDA-approved drugs for inhibitors of Zika virus infection.Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google ScholarDaptomycinApproved/antibacterialZIKVInfected cells in vitroND8Barrows N.J. et al.A screen of FDA-approved drugs for inhibitors of Zika virus infection.Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google ScholarNiclosamideApproved/antiparasiticZIKVInfected cells in vitroND andNS2B/NS3 protease9Xu M. et al.Identification of small-molecule inhibitors of Zika virus infection and induced neural cell death via a drug repurposing screen.Nat.

Taxonomic schemes currently allow for the identification of six Aeromonas species (five mesophilic and one psychrophilic), four of the five mesophilic species having been recovered from infectious processes or isolated from clinical material of human origin. Two major categories of human illness attributed to Aeromonas species have been observed: acute gastroenteritis in both pediatric and adult populations and disseminated disease (e.g., bacteremia) in persons with underlying hematologic malignancies or hepatic dysfunctions. Although the role of mesophilic aeromonads as important agents of bacterial gastroenteritis remains unconfirmed because of the inability to fulfill Koch's postulates (no animal model), several lines of compelling clinical and laboratory evidence indicate that these microorganisms are significant enteric pathogens.",

The compounds are analogues of the new tuberculosis (TB) drug SQ109 (1), which has been reported to act by inhibiting a transporter called MmpL3, involved in cell wall biosynthesis. We show that 1 and the new compounds also target enzymes involved in menaquinone biosynthesis and electron transport, inhibiting respiration and ATP biosynthesis, and are uncouplers, collapsing the pH gradient and membrane potential used to power transporters. The result of such multitarget inhibition is potent inhibition of TB cell growth, as well as very low rates of spontaneous drug resistance. Several targets are absent in humans but are present in other bacteria, as well as in malaria parasites, whose growth is also inhibited.",

There is considerable effort directed towards understanding and negating the proliferation of infectious diseases. Biosensors are an attractive tool which have the potential to detect the outbreak of a virus and/or disease. Although there is a host of technologies available, either commercially or in the scientific literature, the development of biosensors for the detection of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) is still in its infancy. There is no doubt that the glucose biosensor, the gene chip, the protein chip, etc. have all played and are still playing a significant role in monitoring various biomolecules. Can biosensors play an important role for the detection of emerging infectious diseases? What does the future hold and which biosensor technology platform is suitable for the real-time detection of infectious diseases? These and many other questions will be addressed in this review. The purpose of this review is to present an overview of biosensors particularly in relation to EIDs. It provides a synopsis of the various types of biosensor technologies that have been used to detect EIDs, and describes some of the technologies behind them in terms of transduction and bioreceptor principles.",

    "abstract_text": "The quality of water, whether it is used for drinking, irrigation or recreational purposes, is significant for health in both developing and developed countries worldwide. In responding to this challenge, countries develop standards intended to protect public health.\n\nRecognising this, the World Health Organization (WHO) develops \u2018guidelines\u2019 that present an authoritative assessment of the health risks associated with hazards through water and of the effectiveness of approaches to their control. To date, the various WHO guidelines concerned with water ( Guidelines for drinking-water quality; Guidelines for the safe use of wastewater and excreta in agriculture and aquaculture; Guidelines for safe recreational water environments ) have been developed in isolation from one another. However, their common primary concern is for health hazards derived from excreta.\n\nAddressing their specific areas of concern together will tend to support better health protection and highlight the value of interventions closer to sources of pollution, which may otherwise be under-valued.\n\nThe potential to increase consistency in approaches to assessment and management of water-related microbial hazards was discussed by an international group of experts between 1999 and 2001. These discussions led to the development of a harmonised framework, which was intended to inform the process of development of guidelines and standards. Subsequently, a series of reviews was developed and refined, which addressed the principle issues of concern linking water and health to the establishment and implementation of effective, affordable and efficient guidelines and standards. The book is based on these reviews and the harmonised framework.\n\nThis book will prove invaluable to all those concerned with issues relating to microbial water quality and health, including environmental and public health scientists, water scientists, policy makers and those responsible for developing standards and regulations.\n\nThis title belongs to WHO Water Series .\n\nISBN: 9781780405889 (eBook)\n\nISBN: 9781900222280 (Print)",

There is a relationship between addictive drugs of abuse such as alcohol and nicotine in cigarette smoke, as well as illegal drugs such as opiates, cocaine and marijuana, and increased susceptibility to infections. The nature and mechanisms of immunomodulation induced by such drugs of abuse are described in this review. The effects of opiates and marijuana, using animal models as well as in vitro studies with immune cells from experimental animals and humans, have shown that immunomodulation induced by these drugs is mainly receptor-mediated, either directly by interaction with specific receptors on immune cells or indirectly by reaction with similar receptors on cells of the nervous system. Similar studies also show that cocaine and nicotine have marked immunomodulatory effects, which are mainly receptor-mediated. Both cocaine, an illegal drug, and nicotine, a widely used legal addictive component of cigarettes, are markedly immunomodulatory and increase susceptibility to infection. The nature and mechanism of immunomodulation induced by alcohol, the most widely used addictive substance of abuse, are similar but immunomodulatory effects, although not receptor-mediated. The many research studies on the effects of these drugs on immunity and increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, including AIDS, are providing a better understanding of the complex interactions between immunity, infections and substance abuse.",

    "abstract_text": "Sanitation aims to sequester human feces and prevent exposure to fecal pathogens. More than 2.4 billion people worldwide lack access to improved sanitation facilities and almost one billion practice open defecation. We undertook systematic reviews and meta-analyses to compile the most recent evidence on the impact of sanitation on diarrhea, soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, trachoma, schistosomiasis, and nutritional status assessed using anthropometry.We updated previously published reviews by following their search strategy and eligibility criteria. We searched from the previous review's end date to December 31, 2015. We conducted meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect using random-effects models and conducted subgroup analyses to assess impact of different levels of sanitation services and to explore sources of heterogeneity. We assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence from intervention studies using the Liverpool Quality Appraisal Tool (LQAT) and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, respectively. A total of 171 studies met the review's inclusion criteria, including 64 studies not included in the previous reviews. Overall, the evidence suggests that sanitation is protective against diarrhea, active trachoma, some STH infections, schistosomiasis, and height-for-age, with no protective effect for other anthropometric outcomes. The evidence was generally of poor quality, heterogeneity was high, and GRADE scores ranged from very low to high.This review confirms positive impacts of sanitation on aspects of health. Evidence gaps remain and point to the need for research that rigorously describes sanitation implementation and type of sanitation interventions.",

The beneficial roles of autophagy can now be extended to supporting cell survival and regulating inflammation. Autophagic control of inflammation is one area where autophagy may have similar benefits for both infectious and neurodegenerative diseases beyond direct removal of the pathogenic agents.

While the role of hepcidin in iron regulation is well established, its contribution to host defense is emerging as complex and multifaceted. In this review, we summarize the literature on the role of hepcidin as a mediator of antimicrobial immunity. Hepcidin induction during infection causes depletion of extracellular iron, which is thought to be a general defense mechanism against many infections by withholding iron from invading pathogens. Conversely, by promoting iron sequestration in macrophages, hepcidin may be detrimental to cellular defense against certain intracellular infections, although critical in vivo studies are needed to confirm this concept. It is not yet clear whether hepcidin exerts any iron-independent effects on host defenses.",

Although their use in the treatment of bacterial infection has largely been supplanted by antibiotics, antibodies remain a critical component of the treatment of diptheria, tetanus, and botulism. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin can be used to treat certain viral infections in immunocompromised patients (e.g., cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, and enterovirus infections). Antibodies may also be of value in toxic shock syndrome, Ebola virus, and refractory staphylococcal infections. Palivizumab, the first monoclonal antibody licensed (in 1998) for an infectious disease, can prevent respiratory syncytial virus infection in high-risk infants. The development and use of additional monoclonal antibodies to key epitopes of microbial pathogens may further define protective humoral responses and lead to new approaches for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "The processes which give rise to emerging infectious diseases of wildlife can be categorised as follows: ecosystem alterations of anthropogenic or natural origin; movement of pathogens or vectors, via human or natural agency; and changes in microbes or in the recognition of emerging pathogens due to advances in the techniques of epidemiology. These are simplistic divisions because factors influencing the emergence of diseases of wild animals generally fall into more than one category. Mycoplasmosis among passerines is related to habitat changes and artificial feeding resulting in increased bird densities and subsequent disease transmission. The origin of this strain of Mycoplasma gallisepticum is not known. Hantavirus infections in rodents have emerged due to human-induced landscape alterations and/or climatic changes influencing population dynamics of hantavirus reservoir hosts, with disease consequences for humans. Movement of pathogens or vectors is a very important process by which diseases of wildlife expand geographic range. Although the origin of caliciviruses of rabbits and hares is somewhat obscure, their movement by humans, either deliberately or accidentally, has greatly expanded the distribution of these viruses. Rabies is an ancient disease, but geographic expansion has occurred by both natural and anthropogenic movements of wild animals. Human movement of amphibians may explain the distribution of the highly pathogenic chytrid fungus around the world. Newly recognised paramyxoviruses may reflect both changes in these pathogens and the development of techniques of identification and classification. Many more such examples of emerging diseases will arise in the future, given the extensive alterations in landscapes world-wide and movements of animals, vectors and pathogens. Those who study and diagnose diseases of wildlife must be alert for emerging diseases so that the impact of such diseases on wild animals, domestic animals and humans can be minimised.",

This animal model has been used for approximately 200 y and was the first to be used in the study of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria. Today the guinea pig is used as a model for a number of infectious bacterial diseases, including pulmonary, sexually transmitted, ocular and aural, gastrointestinal, and other infections that threaten the lives of humans. Most studies on the immune response to these diseases, with potential therapies and vaccines, have been conducted in animal models (for example, mouse) that may have less similarity to humans because of the large number of immunologic reagents available for these other species. This review presents some of the diseases for which the guinea pig is regarded as the premier model to study infections because of its similarity to humans with regard to symptoms and immune response. Furthermore, for diseases in which guinea pigs share parallel pathogenesis of disease with humans, they are potentially the best animal model for designing treatments and vaccines. Future studies of immune regulation of these diseases, novel therapies, and preventative measures require the development of new immunologic reagents designed specifically for the guinea pig.",

After 100 years of research on man and animals, psychological stress is considered as a potential cofactor in the pathogenesis of infectious disease. Psychological stress seems able to alter the susceptibility of animals and man to infectious agents, influencing the onset, course and outcome of certain infectious pathologies. Many experiments have identified in neuroimmunomodulation the principal mediator of the alterations associated with conditions of stress. The development of psychoneuroimmunology has fostered in-depth study of the complex relationship between psychosocial factors, the central nervous system, the immune system and infectious disease. Although antimicrobial drugs have certainly remained the basis of all anti-infective therapy, this type of study has already led some authors to propose and experiment protocols of psychological intervention or psychoimmunotherapy in pathologies such as tuberculosis, or herpes simplex virus or human immunodeficiency virus infections. The psychoneuroimmunological approach to infectious diseases will probably grow in importance in the future not only in the setting of research in psychosomatic medicine but also in that of clinical microbiology.",

Following a flood, there exists the potential for transmission of water-borne diseases and for increased levels of endemic illnesses such as vector-borne diseases. Therefore, consideration of the situation of infectious diseases must be addressed when providing relief. The Japan Disaster Relief (JDR) Medical Team was sent to Mozambique where a flood disaster occurred during January to March 2000. The team operated in the Hokwe area of the State of Gaza, in the mid-south of Mozambique where damage was the greatest.An epidemiological study was conducted. Information was collected from medical records by abstracting data at local medical facilities, interviewing in habitants and evacuees, and conducting analyses of water.A total of 2,611 patients received medical care during the nine days. Infectious diseases were detected in 85% of all of patients, predominantly malaria, respiratory infectious diseases, and diarrhea. There was no outbreak of cholera or dysentery. Self-reports of the level of health decreased among the flood victims after the event. The incidence of malaria increased by four to five times over non-disaster periods, and the quality of drinking water deteriorated after the event.Both the number of patients and the incidence of endemic infectious diseases, such as malaria and diarrhea, increased following the flood. Also, there was a heightening of risk factors for infectious diseases such as an increase in population, deterioration of physical strength due to the shortage of food and the temporary living conditions for safety purposes, and turbid degeneration of drinking water. These findings support the hypotheses that there exists the potential for the increased transmission of water borne diseases and that there occurs increased levels of endemic illnesses during the post-flood period.",

Most network-based studies of this spread focus on the impact of variations in degree (the number of contacts an individual has). However, other effects such as clustering, variations in infectiousness or susceptibility, or variations in closeness of contacts may play a significant role. We develop analytic techniques to predict how these effects alter the growth rate, probability and size of epidemics, and validate the predictions with a realistic social network. We find that (for a given degree distribution and average transmissibility) clustering is the dominant factor controlling the growth rate, heterogeneity in infectiousness is the dominant factor controlling the probability of an epidemic and heterogeneity in susceptibility is the dominant factor controlling the size of an epidemic. Edge weights (measuring closeness or duration of contacts) have impact only if correlations exist between different edges. Combined, these effects can play a minor role in reinforcing one another, with the impact of clustering the largest when the population is maximally heterogeneous or if the closer contacts are also strongly clustered. Our most significant contribution is a systematic way to address clustering in infectious disease models, and our results have a number of implications for the design of interventions.",

    "abstract_text": "Infectious diseases account for nearly one fifth of the worldwide death toll every year. The continuous increase of drug-resistant pathogens is a big challenge for treatment of infectious diseases. In addition, outbreaks of infections and new pathogens are potential threats to public health. Lack of effective treatments for drug-resistant bacteria and recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viral infections have become a global public health concern. The number of newly approved antibiotics has decreased significantly in the last two decades compared with previous decades. In parallel with this, is an increase in the number of drug-resistant bacteria. For these threats and challenges to be countered, new strategies and technology platforms are critically needed. Drug repurposing has emerged as an alternative approach for rapid identification of effective therapeutics to treat the infectious diseases. For treatment of severe infections, synergistic drug combinations using approved drugs identified from drug repurposing screens is a useful option which may overcome the problem of weak activity of individual drugs. Collaborative efforts including government, academic researchers and private drug industry can facilitate the translational research to produce more effective new therapeutic agents such as narrow spectrum antibiotics against drug-resistant bacteria for these global challenges.This article is part of a themed section on Inventing New Therapies Without Reinventing the Wheel: The Power of Drug Repurposing.

The application of the regression approaches from this tradition to infectious diseases, however, is less well explored and raises some new issues. We discuss and present potential solutions for five issues often arising in such analyses: changes in immune population, strong autocorrelations, a wide range of plausible lag structures and association patterns, seasonality adjustments, and large overdispersion. The potential approaches are illustrated with datasets of cholera cases and rainfall from Bangladesh and influenza and temperature in Tokyo. Though this article focuses on the application of the traditional time series regression to infectious diseases and weather factors, we also briefly introduce alternative approaches, including mathematical modeling, wavelet analysis, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. Modifications proposed to standard time series regression practice include using sums of past cases as proxies for the immune population, and using the logarithm of lagged disease counts to control autocorrelation due to true contagion, both of which are motivated from \"susceptible-infectious-recovered\" (SIR) models. The complexity of lag structures and association patterns can often be informed by biological mechanisms and explored by using distributed lag non-linear models. For overdispersed models, alternative distribution models such as quasi-Poisson and negative binomial should be considered. Time series regression can be used to investigate dependence of infectious diseases on weather, but may need modifying to allow for features specific to this context.",

Polymorphisms in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) have been related to susceptibility to Gram-negative infections and septic shock. Here we show that two polymorphisms of TLR4, Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile, have unique distributions in populations from Africa, Asia, and Europe. Genetic and functional studies are compatible with a model in which the nonsynonymous polymorphism Asp299Gly has evolved as a protective allele against malaria, explaining its high prevalence in subSaharan Africa. However, the same allele could have been disadvantageous after migration of modern humans into Eurasia, putatively because of increased susceptibility to severe bacterial infections. In contrast, the Asp299Gly allele, when present in cosegregation with Thr399Ile to form the Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile haplotype, shows selective neutrality. Polymorphisms in TLR4 exemplify how the interaction between our innate immune system and the infectious pressures in particular environments may have shaped the genetic variations and function of our immune system during the out-of-Africa migration of modern humans.",

    "abstract_text": "Background Given the extensive time needed to conduct a nationally representative household survey and the commonly low response rate of phone surveys, rapid online surveys may be a promising method to assess and track knowledge and perceptions among the general public during fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks. Objective This study aimed to apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the general public in the United States and the United Kingdom. Methods An online questionnaire was administered to 3000 adults residing in the United States and 3000 adults residing in the United Kingdom who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. Prolific Academic established strata by age (18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-57, or \u226558 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (white, black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, mixed, or \u201cother\u201d), as well as all permutations of these strata. The number of participants who could enroll in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. Enrollment into the survey within each stratum was on a first-come, first-served basis. Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2, 2020. Results A total of 2986 and 2988 adults residing in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively, completed the questionnaire. Of those, 64.4% (1924/2986) of US participants and 51.5% (1540/2988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree, 67.5% (2015/2986) of US participants had a total household income between US $20,000 and US $99,999, and 74.4% (2223/2988) of UK participants had a total household income between \u00a315,000 and \u00a374,999. US and UK participants\u2019 median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 5.0% (IQR 2.0%-15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR 2.0%-10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI 36.1%-39.6%) of US participants and 29.7% (95% CI 28.1%-31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was \u201chighly effective\u201d in protecting them from acquiring COVID-19, and 25.6% (95% CI 24.1%-27.2%) of US participants and 29.6% (95% CI 28.0%-31.3%) of UK participants thought it was prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8%, 95% CI 52.1%-55.6%) of US participants and 39.1% (95% CI 37.4%-40.9%) of UK participants thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the US and UK general population. The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media. More broadly, rapid online surveys could be an important tool in tracking the public\u2019s knowledge and misperceptions during rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks.",

    "abstract_text": "In recent years, genomics has increased the understanding of many diseases. Proteomics is a rapidly growing research area that encompasses both genetic and environmental factors. The protein composition represents the functional status of a biological compartment. The five approaches presented here resulted in the detection of disease-associated proteins. Calgranulin B was upregulated in colorectal cancer, and hepatoma-derived aldose reductase-like protein was reexpressed in a rat model during hepatocarcinogenesis. In these two investigations, attention was focused on one protein, obviously differing in amount, directly after two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Additional methods, such as enzyme activity measurements and immunohistochemistry, confirmed the disease association of the two candidates resulting from 2-DE subtractive analysis. The following three investigations take advantage of the holistic potential of the 2-DE approach. The comparison of 2-DE patterns from dilated cardiomyopathy patients with those of controls revealed 25 statistically significant intensity differences, from which 12 were identified by amino acid analysis, Edman degradation or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). A human myocardial 2-DE database was constructed, containing 3300 protein spots and 150 identified protein species. The number of identified proteins was limited by the capacity of our group, rather than by the principle of feasibility. Another field where proteomics proves to be a valuable tool in identifying proteins of importance for diagnosis is proteome analysis of pathogenic microorganisms such as Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) and Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis). Sera from patients with early or late symptoms of Lyme borreliosis contained antibodies of various classes against about 80 antigens each, containing the already described antigens OspA, B and C, flagellin, p83/100, and p39. Similarly, antibody reactivity to seven different marker antigens of T. gondii allowed differentiation between acute and latent toxoplasmosis, an important diagnostic tool in both pregnancy and immunosuppressed patients.",

    "abstract_text": "For some countries, favourable climatic conditions for tourism are often associated with favourable conditions for infectious diseases, with the ensuing development constraints on the tourist sectors of impoverished countries where tourism's economic contribution has a high potential. This paper evaluates the economic implications of eradication of Malaria, Dengue, Yellow Fever and Ebola on the affected destination countries focusing on the tourist expenditures. A gravity model for international tourism flows is used to provide an estimation of the impact of each travel-related disease on international tourist arrivals. Next the potential eradication of these diseases in the affected countries is simulated and the impact on tourism expenditures is estimated. The results show that, in the case of Malaria, Dengue, Yellow Fever and Ebola, the eradication of these diseases in the affected countries would result in an increase of around 10 million of tourist worldwide and a rise in the tourism expenditure of 12 billion dollars. By analysing the economic benefits of the eradication of Dengue, Ebola, Malaria, and Yellow Fever for the tourist sector-a strategic economic sector for many of the countries where these TRD are present-this paper explores a new aspect of the quantification of health policies which should be taken into consideration in future international health assessment programmes. It is important to note that the analysis is only made of the direct impact of the diseases' eradication and consequently the potential multiplicative effects of a growth in the GDP, in terms of tourism attractiveness, are not evaluated. Consequently, the economic results can be considered to be skeleton ones.",

Unfortunately, the phylogenetic trees typically used to represent this variation are not directly informative about who infected whom\u2014a phylogenetic tree is not a transmission tree. However, a transmission tree can be inferred from a phylogeny while accounting for within-host genetic diversity by coloring the branches of a phylogeny according to which host those branches were in. Here we extend this approach and show that it can be applied to partially sampled and ongoing outbreaks. This requires computing the correct probability of an observed transmission tree and we herein demonstrate how to do this for a large class of epidemiological models. We also demonstrate how the branch coloring approach can incorporate a variable number of unique colors to represent unsampled intermediates in transmission chains. The resulting algorithm is a reversible jump Monte\u2013Carlo Markov Chain, which we apply to both simulated data and real data from an outbreak of tuberculosis. By accounting for unsampled cases and an outbreak which may not have reached its end, our method is uniquely suited to use in a public health environment during real-time outbreak investigations. We implemented this transmission tree inference methodology in an R package called TransPhylo, which is freely available from https://github.com/xavierdidelot/TransPhylo.",

The strains for human use were specifically chosen since they are known to be safe for human use, which is of major importance because the fish are meant for human consumption. The selection was carried out by five different methods: mucosal adhesion, mucosal penetration, inhibition of pathogen growth and adhesion, and resistance to fish bile. The adhesion abilities of the seven LAB and three fish pathogens, Vibrio anguillarum, Aeromonas salmonicida , and Flavobacterium psychrophilum , were determined to mucus from five different sites on the surface or in the gut of rainbow trout. Five of the tested LAB strains showed considerable adhesion to different fish mucus types (14 to 26% of the added bacteria). Despite their adhesive character, the LAB strains were not able to inhibit the mucus binding of A. salmonicida . Coculture experiments showed significant inhibition of growth of A. salmonicida , which was mediated by competition for nutrients rather than secretion of inhibitory substances by the probiotic bacteria as measured in spent culture liquid. All LAB except L. casei Shirota showed tolerance against fish bile. L. rhamnosus ATCC 53103 and L. bulgaricus were found to penetrate fish mucus better than other probiotic bacteria. Based on bile resistance, mucus adhesion, mucus penetration, and suppression of fish pathogen growth, L. rhamnosus ATCC 53103 and L. bulgaricus can be considered for future in vivo challenge studies in fish as a novel and safe treatment in aquaculture.",

IDPs have controlled antimicrobial costs by the use of eight strategies: education, formulary restriction, pharmacy justification, formulary substitution, computer surveillance, laboratory item cost listing, purchase plans, and multidisciplinary approaches. Most strategies had input from IDPs and resulted in cost savings (up to $500,000 annually), particularly during the initiation periods. Educational efforts were successful in reducing costs but needed continual intervention. Formulary restriction was the most straightforward cost-control mechanism. Restriction of \"target antimicrobials\" has given way to \"switch\" therapy between expensive and less costly agents or between parenteral and oral regimens. Switch therapy is facilitated through the use of innovative order forms and on-line computer interaction. Computer surveillance has a capacity for interactive controls. Purchase plans may give way to centralized pharmacy monitoring, a strategy that is attractive to managed care organizations. Multidisciplinary antimicrobial management programs (AMPs) offer the best potential for sustaining savings in antimicrobial costs. Ten recommendations lay a groundwork for IDPs to translate their expertise into leadership of AMPs.",

A plausible and testable human genetic theory of primary infectious diseases has recently emerged, building on elegant studies in plants and animals. Three examples of monogenic resistance to common infections have been discovered. Moreover, a growing range of monogenic single-gene inborn errors of immunity, rarely Mendelian (with complete clinical penetrance) but more commonly non-Mendelian (with incomplete penetrance), have been found to underlie severe infectious diseases striking otherwise healthy children during primary infection. These findings provide a synthetic framework for inherited and infectious diseases and, more generally, for inborn and environmental conditions.",

Mental health issues that coincide with emerging diseases and epidemics are rarely examined and sometimes, even eschewed due to cultural considerations. Psychiatric manifestations of various infectious diseases, especially with a focus on Ebola Virus disease (EVD) and Zika Virus, are discussed in this commentary to illustrate the continued need of care after the resolution of the actual illness. Various infectious diseases have associations with mental illness, such as an increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorders and Tourette syndrome in children with Group B streptococcal infection. Current EVD literature does not demonstrate a strong association of mental illness symptoms or diseases but there is a necessity of care that extends beyond the illness. Patients and their families experience depression, anxiety, trauma, suicidal ideation, panic and other manifestations. Zika virus has been associated neuronal injury, genetic alteration that affects fetal development and detrimental maternal mental health symptoms are being documented. While funding calls from the international community are present, there are no specific epidemiological data or fiscal estimates solely for mental health during or after infectious diseases epidemics or disasters that support health care providers and strengthen policies and procedures for responding to such situations. Therefore, those on the frontlines of epidemics including emergency physicians, primary care providers and infectious disease specialists should serve communicate this need and advocate for sustained and increased funding for mental health programs to heighten public awareness regarding acute psychiatric events during infectious diseases outbreaks and offer treatment and support when necessary.",

    "abstract_text": "Studies of the biofilm life cycle can identify novel targets and strategies for improving biofilm control measures. Of particular interest are dispersal events, where a subpopulation of cells is released from the biofilm community to search out and colonize new surfaces. Recently, the simple gas and ubiquitous biological signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) was identified as a key mediator of biofilm dispersal conserved across microbial species. Here, we review the role and mechanisms of NO mediating dispersal in bacterial biofilms, and its potential for novel therapeutics. In contrast to previous attempts using high dose NO aimed at killing pathogens, the use of low, non-toxic NO signals (picomolar to nanomolar range) to disperse biofilms represents an innovative and highly favourable approach to improve infectious disease treatments. Further, several NO-based technologies have been developed that offer a versatile range of solutions to control biofilms, including: (i) NO-generating compounds with short or long half-lives and safe or inert residues, (ii) novel compounds for the targeted delivery of NO to infectious biofilms during systemic treatments, and (iii) novel NO-releasing materials and surface coatings for the prevention and dispersal of biofilms. Overall the use of low levels of NO exploiting its signaling properties to induce dispersal represents an unprecedented and promising strategy for the control of biofilms in clinical and industrial contexts.

We searched for a global phenotypic characteristic that was highly conserved among cancer stem cells, across multiple tumor types, to provide a mutation-independent approach to cancer therapy. This would allow us to target cancer stem cells, effectively treating cancer as a single disease of &ldquo;stemness&rdquo;, independently of the tumor tissue type. Using this approach, we identified a conserved phenotypic weak point &ndash; a strict dependence on mitochondrial biogenesis for the clonal expansion and survival of cancer stem cells. Interestingly, several classes of FDA-approved antibiotics inhibit mitochondrial biogenesis as a known &ldquo;side-effect&rdquo;, which could be harnessed instead as a &ldquo;therapeutic effect&rdquo;. Based on this analysis, we now show that 4-to-5 different classes of FDA-approved drugs can be used to eradicate cancer stem cells, in 12 different cancer cell lines, across 8 different tumor types (breast, DCIS, ovarian, prostate, lung, pancreatic, melanoma, and glioblastoma (brain)). These five classes of mitochondrially-targeted antibiotics include: the erythromycins, the tetracyclines, the glycylcyclines, an anti-parasitic drug, and chloramphenicol. Functional data are presented for one antibiotic in each drug class: azithromycin, doxycycline, tigecycline, pyrvinium pamoate, as well as chloramphenicol, as proof-of-concept. Importantly, many of these drugs are non-toxic for normal cells, likely reducing the side effects of anti-cancer therapy. Thus, we now propose to treat cancer like an infectious disease, by repurposing FDA-approved antibiotics for anti-cancer therapy, across multiple tumor types. These drug classes should also be considered for prevention studies, specifically focused on the prevention of tumor recurrence and distant metastasis. Finally, recent clinical trials with doxycycline and azithromycin (intended to target cancer-associated infections, but not cancer cells) have already shown positive therapeutic effects in cancer patients, although their ability to eradicate cancer stem cells was not yet appreciated.",

    "abstract_text": "A statistical model is presented for the analysis of infectious disease data from family studies in the community. The model partitions the sources of infection into those from within the household and those from the community at large. The parameters reflecting these sources of infection are estimated as functions of the risk factors. This new model is used to overcome problems associated with the lack of independence of observations in infectious disease data and negative confounding due to the association of unmeasured exposures and immunity. An example of how this new statistical model is used to provide a clearer and less confounded description of risk factor effects is presented for data from influenza A(H3N2) epidemic seasons in the Tecumseh Respiratory Illness Study. The risk factors examined are age and pre-epidemic season antibody level as measured by the hemagglutination-inhibition test, while the outcome is the infection rate. A standard analysis of the data indicates that the efficacy of protective antibodies is 70% in children and only 47% in adults. However, such an efficacy measurement is negatively confounded by past exposure which is age dependent. By means of the model, the true, unconfounded, efficacy of protective antibodies is shown to be 90% in both adults and children.",

We analysed macroand micro-structural elements in 2 heterosexual networks, augmented by ethnographic observations. In a Colorado cohort of injecting drug users (n=595), measures of subgroup formation and of density of activity show decrease of network cohesion over time; only one HIV transmission was observed in 3 years. In a group of adolescent heterosexuals in Georgia (n=99), the reverse process (increase in structural cohesion) was associated with efficient syphilis transmission: 10 cases were observed. Changes in personal risk behaviours over time were modest. STD/HIV transmission patterns were associated with intensification or diminution of network cohesion. Network and ethnographic data suggest that enhanced connectivity facilitates transmission while segmentation impedes it, suggesting opportunities for interventions. These data also emphasize the need to re-evaluate purely behavioural explanations of STD/HIV transmission.",

    "abstract_text": "The parasite paradox arises from the dual observations that parasites (broadly construed, including phytophagous insects) are resource specialists with restricted host ranges, and yet shifts onto relatively unrelated hosts are common in the phylogenetic diversification of parasite lineages and directly observable in ecological time. We synthesize the emerging solution to this paradox: phenotypic flexibility and phylogenetic conservatism in traits related to resource use, grouped under the term ecological fitting, provide substantial opportunities for rapid host switching in changing environments, in the absence of the evolution of novel host-utilization capabilities. We discuss mechanisms behind ecological fitting, its implications for defining specialists and generalists, and briefly review empirical examples of host shifts in the context of ecological fitting. We conclude that host shifts via ecological fitting provide the fuel for the expansion phase of the recently proposed oscillation hypothesis of host range and speciation, and, more generally, the generation of novel combinations of interacting species within the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution. Finally, we conclude that taxon pulses, driven by climate change and large-scale ecological perturbation are drivers of biotic mixing and resultant ecological fitting, which leads to increased rates of rapid host switching, including the agents of Emerging Infectious Disease.",

    "abstract_text": "The spread of infectious diseases fundamentally depends on the pattern of contacts between individuals. Although studies of contact networks have shown that heterogeneity in the number of contacts and the duration of contacts can have far-reaching epidemiological consequences, models often assume that contacts are chosen at random and thereby ignore the sociological, temporal and/or spatial clustering of contacts. Here we investigate the simultaneous effects of heterogeneous and clustered contact patterns on epidemic dynamics. To model population structure, we generalize the configuration model which has a tunable degree distribution (number of contacts per node) and level of clustering (number of three cliques). To model epidemic dynamics for this class of random graph, we derive a tractable, low-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations that accounts for the effects of network structure on the course of the epidemic. We find that the interaction between clustering and the degree distribution is complex. Clustering always slows an epidemic, but simultaneously increasing clustering and the variance of the degree distribution can increase final epidemic size. We also show that bond percolation-based approximations can be highly biased if one incorrectly assumes that infectious periods are homogeneous, and the magnitude of this bias increases with the amount of clustering in the network. We apply this approach to model the high clustering of contacts within households, using contact parameters estimated from survey data of social interactions, and we identify conditions under which network models that do not account for household structure will be biased.",

    "abstract_text": "The convergence of non-communicable disease (NCD) and infectious disease (ID) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) presents new challenges and new opportunities to enact responsive changes in policy and research. Most LMICs have significant dual disease burdens of NCDs such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer, and IDs including tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and parasitic diseases. A combined strategy is needed in surveillance and disease control; yet, experts, institutions and policies that support prevention and control of these two overarching disease categories have limited interaction and alignment. NCDs and IDs share common features, such as long-term care needs and overlapping high-risk populations, and there are also notable direct interactions, such as the association between certain IDs and cancers, as well as evidence of increased susceptibility to IDs in individuals with NCDs. Enhanced simultaneous surveillance of NCD and ID comorbidity in LMIC populations would generate the empirical data needed to better understand the dual burden, and to target coordinated care. Where IDs and NCDs are endemic, focusing on vulnerable populations by strengthening social protections and improving access to health services is crucial, as is the re-alignment of efforts to combine NCD and ID screening, treatment programmes, and the assessment of their impact. Integrating public health activities for ID and NCD should extend beyond health care services to prevention, which is widely seen as crucial to successful NCD and ID control campaigns alike. The convergence of NCD and ID in LMICs has the potential to overstretch already strained health systems. With some LMICs now focused on major health system reforms, a unique opportunity is available to address NCD and ID challenges with newfound urgency and novel approaches.",

    "abstract_text": "OBJECTIVE. This study describes the burden and epidemiologic features of infectious disease hospitalizations among infants in the United States. METHODS. Hospitalizations with an infectious disease listed as a primary diagnosis for infants (&amp;lt;1 year of age) in the United States during 2003 were examined by using the Kids' Inpatient Database. National estimates of infectious disease hospitalizations, hospitalization rates, and various hospital parameters were examined. RESULTS. During 2003, an estimated 286739 infectious disease hospitalizations occurred among infants in the United States and accounted for 42.8% of all infant hospitalizations. The national infectious disease hospitalization rate was 7010.8 hospitalizations per 100000 live births, or \u223c1 infectious disease hospitalization for every 14 infants. The median length of stay was 3 days, and stays totaled &amp;gt;1 million hospital days for infants. Infectious disease hospitalization rates were highest among boys and nonwhite infants. The most commonly listed diagnoses among the infant infectious disease hospitalizations included lower respiratory tract infections (59.0%), kidney, urinary tract, and bladder infections (7.6%), upper respiratory tract infections (6.5%), and septicemia (6.5%). The median cost of an infectious disease hospitalization was $2235, with total annual hospital costs of approximately $690 million, among infants in the United States. CONCLUSIONS. Infectious disease hospitalizations among infants account for substantial health care expenditures and hospital time in the United States, with respiratory disease hospitalizations constituting more than one half of all hospitalizations. Younger infants, boys, and nonwhite infants were at increased risk for infectious disease hospitalization. Measures to reduce racial disparities and the occurrence of respiratory tract infections should substantially decrease the infectious disease burden among infants.",

A complex combination of environmental, pathogen and host genetic factors plays a role in determining both susceptibility to particular microbes and the course of infection. Numerous studies have now mapped and identified relevant genes using a variety of both family-based and population-based approaches. Much interest has been focused on susceptibility to malaria, HIV/AIDS and mycobacterial infection, but other bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases are receiving increasing attention. Some major genes have been identified by genome scans of multi-case families, and mouse genetics has contributed to mapping and identification of a few genes. However, the great majority of known susceptibility loci emerged from screening of likely candidate genes. The emerging picture is of highly polygenic diseases, with occasional major genes, along with significant inter-population heterogeneity. This genetic architecture likely reflects the role that evolutionary selection has played in generating and maintaining a diverse repertoire of susceptibility/resistance loci, most with individually small effects. Genome-wide association studies with large sample sizes will be required to define the majority of the relevant polygenes.",

We incorporate this information in space\u2013time models for infectious disease surveillance data to better capture the dynamics of disease spread. Two previously established model classes are extended, which both decompose disease risk additively into endemic and epidemic components: a spatio-temporal point process model for individual-level data and a multivariate time-series model for aggregated count data. In both frameworks, a power-law decay of spatial interaction is embedded into the epidemic component and estimated jointly with all other unknown parameters using (penalised) likelihood inference. Whereas the power law can be based on Euclidean distance in the point process model, a novel formulation is proposed for count data where the power law depends on the order of the neighbourhood of discrete spatial units. The performance of the new approach is investigated by a reanalysis of individual cases of invasive meningococcal disease in Germany (2002\u20132008) and count data on influenza in 140 administrative districts of Southern Germany (2001\u20132008). In both applications, the power law substantially improves model fit and predictions, and is reasonably close to alternative qualitative formulations, where distance and order of neighbourhood, respectively, are treated as a factor. Implementation in the R package surveillance allows the approach to be applied in other settings.",

The burgeoning field of landscape epidemiology integrates concepts and approaches from disease ecology with the macroscale lens of landscape ecology, enabling examination of disease across spatiotemporal scales in complex environmental settings. We review the state of the field and describe analytical frontiers that show promise for advancement, focusing on natural and human-altered ecosystems. Concepts fundamental to practicing landscape epidemiology are discussed, including spatial scale, static versus dynamic modeling, spatially implicit versus explicit approaches, selection of ecologically meaningful variables, and inference versus prediction. We highlight studies that have advanced the field by incorporating multiscale analyses, landscape connectivity, and dynamic modeling. Future research directions include understanding disease as a component of interacting ecological disturbances, scaling up the ecological impacts of disease, and examining disease dynamics as a coupled human-natural system.",

    "abstract_text": "<h3>BACKGROUND</h3> It has been reported that pranlukast reduces the antigen induced immediate and late phase asthmatic responses, airway hyperreactivity to acetylcholine, and pulmonary eosinophil accumulation in guinea pigs. A study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that pranlukast may reduce the number of inflammatory cells in the bronchial mucosa of patients with asthma. <h3>METHODS</h3> A double blind, placebo controlled study was performed in 17 mild to moderate asthmatic subjects to examine changes in inflammatory cell infiltration in response to pranlukast (225 mg orally twice per day for four weeks). Comparisons of the mean daily \u03b2<sub>2</sub> agonist use, symptom score, FEV<sub>1</sub> percentage predicted, and airway methacholine responsiveness were made before and after treatment. Using fibreoptic bronchoscopy, bronchial biopsy specimens were obtained before and after treatment with either pranlukast (n = 10) or placebo (n = 7). Immunohistology was performed using monoclonal antibodies for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, NP57, AA1, EG1, EG2, \u03b3GTP and CD19. <h3>RESULTS</h3> When the pranlukast and placebo treated groups were compared there were decreases in \u03b2<sub>2</sub>agonist use, symptom score, and airway methacholine responsiveness after pranlukast but no increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> was seen. The clinical response in patients treated with pranlukast was accompanied by a reduction in CD3 (median difference \u201337, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u201369 to \u20131; p&lt;0.05), CD4 (median difference \u201328, 95% CI \u201349 to \u20138; p&lt;0.01), AA1 (median difference \u201315, 95% CI \u201326 to 0; p&lt;0.05) and EG2 positive cells (95% CI \u201335 to 0; p&lt;0.05), but not in EG1 positive eosinophils, \u03b3GTP positive cells, and CD19 positive plasma cells. <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3> These results support the view that pranlukast may act by inhibition of bronchial inflammation in patients with asthma.",

    "title": "Estimating the global burden of thalassogenic diseases: human infectious diseases caused by wastewater pollution of the marine environment",
    "abstract_text": "This paper presents a preliminary attempt at obtaining an order-of-magnitude estimate of the global burden of disease (GBD) of human infectious diseases associated with swimming/bathing in coastal waters polluted by wastewater, and eating raw or lightly steamed filter-feeding shellfish harvested from such waters. Such diseases will be termed thalassogenic\u2014caused by the sea. Until recently these human health effects have been viewed primarily as local phenomena, not generally included in the world agenda of marine scientists dealing with global marine pollution problems. The massive global scale of the problem can be visualized when one considers that the wastewater and human body wastes of a significant portion of the world's population who reside along the coastline or in the vicinity of the sea are discharged daily, directly or indirectly, into the marine coastal waters, much of it with little or no treatment. Every cubic metre of raw domestic wastewater discharged into the sea can carry millions of infectious doses of pathogenic microorganisms. It is estimated that globally, foreign and local tourists together spend some 2 billion man-days annually at coastal recreational resorts and many are often exposed there to coastal waters polluted by wastewater. Annually some 800 million meals of potentially contaminated filter-feeding shellfish/bivalves and other sea foods, harvested in polluted waters are consumed, much of it raw or lightly steamed. A number of scientific studies have shown that swimmers swallow significant amounts of polluted seawater and can become ill with gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases from the pathogens they ingest. Based on risk assessments from the World Health Organization (WHO) and academic research sources the present study has made an estimate that globally, each year, there are in excess of 120 million cases of gastrointestinal disease and in excess of 50 million cases of more severe respiratory diseases caused by swimming and bathing in wastewater-polluted coastal waters. Filter-feeding shellfish/bivalves, which are often harvested from wastewater-polluted areas of the sea, can effectively filter out and concentrate the microbial pathogens in the seawater. It can be roughly estimated that annually there are some 4 million cases of infectious hepatitis A and E (HAV/HEV), with some 40 thousand deaths and 40 thousand cases of long-term disability, mainly chronic liver damage, from consuming raw or lightly steamed filter-feeding shellfish/molluscs harvested globally from polluted coastal waters. The total global health impact of the thalassogenic diseases\u2014human infectious diseases associated with pathogenic microorganisms from land-based wastewater pollution of the seas\u2014is estimated to be about 3 million \u2018disability-adjusted life years\u2019 (DALY)/year, with an estimated economic loss of some 12 billion dollars per year. Due to the preliminary nature of the estimates in this study it is appropriate to assume that all of the above figures are no more than first approximations and that the true figures may be 50% higher or lower. Nevertheless, it is the author's belief that this study indicates that wastewater pollution of the sea results in a multi-billion dollar per year health burden and that preventing wastewater pollution of the sea is worthy of inclusion on the global agenda of marine pollution prevention and control.",

    "title": "Use of serological surveys to generate key insights into the changing global landscape of infectious disease",
    "abstract_text": "A central conundrum in the study of infectious disease dynamics is to define the landscape of population immunity. The proportion of individuals protected against a specific pathogen determines the timing and scale of outbreaks, and the pace of evolution for infections that can evade prevailing humoral immunity. Serological surveys provide the most direct measurement to define the immunity landscape for many infectious diseases, yet this methodology remains underexploited. To address this gap, we propose a World Serology Bank and associated major methodological developments in serological testing, study design, and quantitative analysis, which could drive a step change in our understanding and optimum control of infectious diseases. Epidemic dynamics result from an interaction between the contagious spread of infection, the resulting depletion of population susceptibility, and its replenishment via births, immigration, or waning immunity. Understanding this interaction is key to assess the effect of vaccination, which artificially reduces the number of people susceptible to infection. Researchers mainly observe infection dynamics and the effect of population (or herd) immunity in limiting spread via surveillance of clinically apparent cases of infection or deaths. This method has led to some powerful insights;1Fine PE Herd immunity: history, theory, practice.Epidemiol Rev. 1993; 15: 265-302PubMed Google Scholar however, even in the simplest instances in which subclinical infection is uncommon, cases only provide information about the dynamics of infection. Susceptibility and immunity are hidden variables. For infections that people can be completely immunised against, such as measles, susceptible reconstruction can be used to estimate immune profiles,2Bj\u00f8rnstad ON Finkenst\u00e4dt BF Grenfell BT Dynamics of measles epidemics: estimating scaling of transmission rates using a time series SIR model.Ecol Monogr. 2002; 72: 169-184Crossref Scopus (411) Google Scholar but infection prevalence and vaccination coverage records are frequently inadequate to capture key social and geographical heterogeneities. Additionally, inference is weakened if the risk of infection is low. Serological surveys (usually used to quantify the proportion of people positive for a specific antibody or, better yet, the titre or concentrations of an antibody) are potentially the most direct and informative technique available to infer the dynamics of a population's susceptibility and level of immunity. However, the use of current serological tests varies greatly depending on type of pathogens and there are major methodological gaps in some areas for some pathogens and tests. In terms of use of current serological methods, infections can be classified into four broad groups (appendix). The first group contains acute immunising, antigenically stable pathogens (eg, measles, rubella, and smallpox) for which serology provides a strong signal of lifetime protection and a clear marker of past infection (or vaccination). The second group contains immunising, but antigenically variable pathogens (eg, influenza, invasive bacterial diseases, and dengue). Despite complexities (appendix), serology in some cases can provide powerful evidence, both for vaccine formulation and pandemic planning.3Van Kerkhove MD Ferguson NM Epidemic and intervention modelling\u2014a scientific rationale for policy decisions? Lessons from the 2009 influenza pandemic.Bull World Health Organ. 2012; 90: 306-310PubMed Google Scholar, 4Boni MF Chau NV Dong N et al.Population-level antibody estimates to novel influenza A/H7N9.J Infect Dis. 2013; 208: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar A serum bank would have been extremely useful in interpretation of the unusual profile of susceptibility associated with age in the 2009 influenza pandemic.3Van Kerkhove MD Ferguson NM Epidemic and intervention modelling\u2014a scientific rationale for policy decisions? Lessons from the 2009 influenza pandemic.Bull World Health Organ. 2012; 90: 306-310PubMed Google Scholar For these first two groups, if suitable serum banks existed, the deployment of current serological tests could have helped to clarify the association between serological profiles and protective immunity. The third group includes infections for which infection-induced antibodies are not thought to be protective, such as tuberculosis in which the targets of the immune response vary with stage of infection; malaria, whereby infected erythrocytes generate several antibodies whose individual importance has not been fully elucidated (and might indicate exposure rather than protection5Drakeley CJ Corran PH Coleman PG et al.Estimating medium- and long-term trends in malaria transmission by using serological markers of malaria exposure.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2005; 102: 5108-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar); and HIV. Although antibodies might not be representative of immunity against a pathogen, they do show current or previous infection. Finally, the last broad grouping consists of infections that do not lead to reliably sustained, measurable antibody responses or for which presence of specific antibodies do not correlate with protection from future infection. These include many enteric infections and the human papillomavirus. In these cases, serological data can nonetheless be valuable to assess a population's coverage of vaccine programmes if vaccination leads to long-lasting antibody responses. In the context of public health, for immunisation against group one infections, vaccination programmes aim to protect vaccinated individuals and indirectly protect unvaccinated individuals by maintaining high population immunity.1Fine PE Herd immunity: history, theory, practice.Epidemiol Rev. 1993; 15: 265-302PubMed Google Scholar If a valid correlate of immunity is measurable in sera, serological surveys could be used to identify population subgroups in which immunity is low, or even to identify individuals in whom immunity has waned, and directly inform targeted vaccination strategies (appendix). Household surveys are a major source of data for vaccination coverage in low-income countries.6Cutts FT Izurieta HS Rhoda DA Measuring coverage in MNCH: design, implementation, and interpretation challenges associated with tracking vaccination coverage using household surveys.PLoS Med. 2013; 10: e1001404Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar The recent extension of efforts to measure biomarkers for infections such as HIV (eg, the Demographic Health Surveys) could provide infrastructure for sera collection for an expanded range of infections, thus leveraging an existing platform. For many infections, however, to distinguish a vaccine-induced antibody response from that which follows natural infection is not possible. Additionally, after an initial successful vaccination, antibody levels might wane to become undetectable. Although these complications preclude simple interpretations of serological assays in the context of vaccination, they are an opportunity to develop new analytical techniques\u2014eg, beyond positive versus negative to a quantitative assessment that might distinguish exposure from infection associated with transmission. Separation of natural and vaccinal immunity would be extremely useful where vaccination coverage is uncertain. However, by contrast with veterinary vaccines,7Uttenthal A Parida S Rasmussen TB Paton DJ Haas B Dundon WG Strategies for differentiating infection in vaccinated animals (DIVA) for foot-and-mouth disease, classical swine fever and avian influenza.Expert Rev Vaccines. 2010; 9: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar this difficult task has not been widely attempted for human infections, and is currently feasible for only a few infections, such as tetanus (infection does not lead to sustained antibody responses) and hepatitis B virus (vaccination only induces antibodies to the surface protein whereas infection also induces antibodies to the core protein). Increasing interest in the development of labelled vaccines is likely to substantially extend this range of infections, especially for newly developed vaccines. The largest cost and logistical challenge involved in serological surveys is often in obtaining specimens. With these in hand, multiplexing testing to address a range of pathogen questions is a natural extension. Emergent data informs strategies for existing public health interventions, but could also contribute to help prioritise the launch of new vaccines. Successful templates for this approach were provided when prevalence of hepatitis surface antigen was used as an indicator of disease burden,8Goldstein ST Zhou F Hadler SC Bell BP Mast EE Margolis HS A mathematical model to estimate global hepatitis B disease burden and vaccination impact.Int J Epidemiol. 2005; 34: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar and age-specific prevalence of rubella antibody was used to estimate burden of congenital rubella syndrome.9Cutts FT Vynnycky E Modelling the incidence of congenital rubella syndrome in developing countries.Int J Epidemiol. 1999; 28: 1176-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar Serological surveys in sentinel areas (focal areas for surveillance) could allow strategic deployment of vaccination or other interventions, maximising use of resources and timely intervention to benefit the entire population. For areas where immunity against a pathogen wanes, age profiles of serology can give insights into the rates of both waning and boosting of immunity from exposure to the infection (protective titres need to be known). Additional data availability would enable increased methodological research into both these inferential questions, and the connected question of translating age prevalence of infection into transmission intensity. Beyond the first two groups (infections that people can be wholly or partly immunised against), the remaining main challenge is to develop new serological methods that clarify the role of non-immunising exposure, the complexities of cross-reactive antibodies, and the extent (or absence) of immune correlates of protection. If these questions can be addressed, serum banks for broad multipathogen targeting could be used to address various public health priorities, such as success of mass drug administration for neglected tropical diseases.10Lammie PJ Moss DM Brook Goodhew E et al.Development of a new platform for neglected tropical disease surveillance.Int J Parasitol. 2012; 42: 797-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar A combination of laboratory innovations (eg, automation, to circumvent laborious individual analyses) and analytical innovations are likely to be needed. Furthermore, with such developments serological surveys will have the potential to answer fundamental questions in infectious disease biology (appendix). For all these reasons, we argue that a World Serology Bank would be a timely and powerful method for next generation surveillance of both established and emerging infections. Advances in the meteorology community provide an analogy: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has thousands of buoys continually reporting ocean environmental conditions.11National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationARGO profiling CTD floats. Data region: global.http://floats.pmel.noaa.gov/dataselect/select.php?area=GLOBALDate: 2014Google Scholar It is extraordinary that no equivalent reporting mechanism is used for the world of animal and human infectious diseases. A World Serology Bank would be immediately useful to help optimise vaccination strategies, and the global end game of eradication for vaccine-preventable infections such as polio, measles, and rubella in which the mapping from individual serology to large-scale epidemic dynamics is especially clear. As spatiotemporal sampling, refinements in methodology, and multiplexing develop, this use of the World Serology Bank would only increase. Furthermore, we argue that the availability of a serum bank would be a key spur to help develop methods for infections that are serologically intractable. An appropriate sampling scheme, powered for a range of infections, and with good laboratory standardisation will be essential. With this scheme in place, annual age stratified sampling of serology at key sentinel sites worldwide could provide a unique window into the global landscape of immunity. Both opportunistic analysis of existing samples and purpose built serum banks could contribute to this resource. Opportunistic samples might be particularly valuable with unusual patterns of infection\u2014eg, showing the extent to which the immune landscape has constrained emergence of enteroviruses in Asia.12Tee KK Lam TT-Y Chan YF et al.Evolutionary genetics of human enterovirus 71: origin, population dynamics, natural selection, and seasonal periodicity of the VP1 gene.J Virol. 2010; 84: 3339-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar The potential for global spread of emerging infections underscores the importance of a global serological bank. In the recent outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; in 2012) and Ebola virus (which began in 2013) it would have been invaluable to know if any evidence showed pre-existing immunity to these diseases in the populations where they emerged, clarifying the role of unseen infections or cross-immunity with other pathogen strains. A system of distributed storage repositories worldwide that draws on existing models for logistics, ethics, and best practices in housing samples and data (appendix), would be a powerful addition to the global health landscape. Every country could contribute to and benefit from such a system. Expansion of the serum bank will need substantial methodological advances in serological techniques (appendix). Development of analytical and modelling techniques to interpret the resulting effects of population immunity2Bj\u00f8rnstad ON Finkenst\u00e4dt BF Grenfell BT Dynamics of measles epidemics: estimating scaling of transmission rates using a time series SIR model.Ecol Monogr. 2002; 72: 169-184Crossref Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 13Lessler J Riley S Read JM et al.Evidence for antigenic seniority in influenza A (H3N2) antibody responses in southern China.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002802Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar is also essential, and equally likely to be inspired by the availability of broad-scale data. To conclude, systematic multiplex estimates of the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual and population immunity to various pathogens would be a powerful new system for global health informatics. A World Serology Bank could boost fundamental understanding of disease dynamics, correlates of protection,14Chen RT Markowitz LE Albrecht P et al.Measles antibody: reevaluation of protective titers.J Infect Dis. 1990; 162: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar effects of control programmes, risks or protective factors of emerging infections, and inform reactive policies in global health.

    "abstract_text": "Abstract Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a common finding in many populations, including healthy women and persons with underlying urologic abnormalities. The 2005 guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures. Treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The guideline did not address children and some adult populations, including patients with neutropenia, solid organ transplants, and nonurologic surgery. In the years since the publication of the guideline, further information relevant to ASB has become available. In addition, antimicrobial treatment of ASB has been recognized as an important contributor to inappropriate antimicrobial use, which promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The current guideline updates the recommendations of the 2005 guideline, includes new recommendations for populations not previously addressed, and, where relevant, addresses the interpretation of nonlocalizing clinical symptoms in populations with a high prevalence of ASB.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract: Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , is an emerging infectious disease implicated in declines of amphibian populations around the globe. An emerging infectious disease is one that has recently been discovered; has recently increased in incidence, geography, or host range; or is newly evolved. For any given outbreak of an emerging disease, it is therefore possible to state two hypotheses regarding its origin. The novel pathogen hypothesis states that the disease has recently spread into new geographic areas, whereas the endemic pathogen hypothesis suggests that it has been present in the environment but recently has increased in host range or pathogenicity. Distinguishing between these hypotheses is important, because the conservation measures needed to slow or stop the spread of a novel pathogen are likely to differ from those needed to prevent outbreaks of an endemic pathogen. Population genetics may help discriminate among the possible origins of an emerging disease. Current evidence suggests chytridiomycosis may be a novel pathogen being spread worldwide by carriers; until we know how much genetic variation to expect in an endemic strain, however, we cannot yet conclude that B. dendrobatidis is a novel pathogen.",

    "abstract_text": "Emerging infectious disease outbreaks, such as the present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, often have a psychological impact on the well-being of the general population, including survivors and caregivers. Our study aimed to synthesise extant literature regarding the combined psychological responses and coping methods used by the general population in past outbreaks. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the published literature over the last two decades with a quality appraisal of included articles that reported both psychological responses and coping strategies within infectious disease outbreaks. A total of 144 papers were identified from the search, 24 of which were included in the review. Overall, 18 studies examined the psychosocial responses of the general population towards the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, four studies focused on the Ebola epidemic and two studies covered the H1N1 outbreak. Common themes in psychological responses included anxiety/fears, depression, anger, guilt, grief and loss, post-traumatic stress and stigmatisation, but also a greater sense of empowerment and compassion towards others. Coping strategies adopted included problem-focused coping (seeking alternatives, self- and other-preservation), seeking social support, avoidance, and positive appraisal of the situation. Amid the range of psychosocial responses seen in past infectious disease outbreaks, practical considerations for the current COVID-19 pandemic need to focus on the individual in the context of the larger social environment, with an emphasis on raising awareness of the range of possible psychosocial responses, access to psychological help, self-care, empowering self-support groups and sustained engagement with updated, reliable information about the outbreak.",

We are facing a post-antibiotic era with a decreased armamentarium to combat infectious diseases. Development of novel drugs will rely on basic research aimed to increase our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and the inter-cellular chemical signalling among bacterial cells. Such basic science, when combined with contemporary drug discovery technologies, may be translated into therapeutic applications to combat bacterial infections. In this review, we discuss many strategies aimed to interfere with bacterial cell-to-cell signalling via the quorum-sensing (QS) pathway to inhibit bacterial virulence and/or the development of microbial communities (known as biofilms), which are refractory to antibiotic treatment. QS antagonists should be viewed as blockers of pathogenicity rather than as anti-microbials and because QS is not involved in bacterial growth, inhibition of QS should not yield a strong selective pressure for development of resistance. QS inhibitors (QSIs) hold great expectations and we look forward to their application in fighting bacterial infections.",

    "abstract_text": "PROBLEMBW agents.The release of a biological weapon (BW) agent by a terrorist group or military force would likely be silent and undetectable or nearly so.As shown by anthrax attack during the fall of 2001 in the eastern United States, patients would begin appearing at hospitals and clinics within several days of exposure, most presenting with nonspecific flu-like symptoms.The first days of the outbreak might not even cause undue concern.However, depending on the type of agent and the method of dispersal, the public healthcare system would rapidly be stretched to capacity and beyond.The qualities that make a good BW agent are its relationship between aerosolization, infectivity, or toxicity and the amount of agent required to produce an effect (48).In addition, criteria such as environmental stability, ease of production, disease severity, and communicability determine which agents are the most likely to be utilized.For maximum effect, an optimal agent should be highly lethal and easily produced in large quantities and have limited options for preventive or prophylactic treatment.Given that the respiratory route is the most effective for most BW agents, stability in an aerosol form and the capability to be readily dispersed also in an aerosol (1-to 10-m particle size) are necessary.When potential agents are reviewed for these characteristics, Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) and variola major virus (smallpox) are considered to have the greatest potential for mass casualties and civil disruption.Also high on a prospective list of agents are botulinum neurotoxins, Yersinia pestis, and Francisella tularensis (48,91, 92).Lower on the prospective list are Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei, Rickettsia sp., Coxiella burnetii, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Marburg and Ebola viruses, and influenza viruses (48,63,91, 92).Emerging infectious disease agents.In addition to diseases caused by intentional epidemics, there are several emerging infectious diseases (ID) with the potential for significant public health consequences, including dengue fever, West Nile fever, and Rift Valley fever as well as the recent reemergence of malaria in the eastern United States (48,63,91, 92).As with BW agents, emerging ID agents may be directly transmissible or vector borne (63).A complex interplay of factors can influence disease emergence, including genetic variation, environmental changes, and population pressures.Further compounding this already complicated situation, are the estimated 600",

The ability of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms to recognize what is most often thought to be hormones restricted to the vertebrate system suggests that the study of microbial endocrinology may have important implications for the pathology of infectious disease.

Apart from cultural and behavioral differences between the sexes that play a prominent role in the exposure to pathogens, increasing data show that women and men also differ in their immune responses to infections. This applies to infections with viruses, bacteria, and parasites, including the pathogens most relevant for human health, causing malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, hepatitis, and influenza. Only recently, the biological pathways responsible for these sex-based differences in the manifestations of infectious diseases have been started to be unveiled. These include immunological pathways affected by sex hormones, as well as consequences of differential expression of X-chromosome-encoded genes on immune responses to pathogens. Further research is required to gain a better understanding of the differences in immunity to infections between women and men in order to develop individualized treatment concepts in infectious diseases that take sex-specific host factors into account.",

Chronic lower airway infections cause a progressive pathologic deterioration of lung tissue, a decline in pulmonary function and, ultimately, respiratory failure and death in 90% of CF patients. Historically, very few bacterial species have been implicated as principal CF pathogens. However, molecular evidence suggests the presence of a diverse mosaic of bacteria in CF lungs, and infections can be defined as polymicrobial. Here we review the work that supports this concept and we discuss the potential significance of the polymicrobial community in lung pathology. Understanding the dynamics of polymicrobial infections, the interplay between pathogen(s), normal oropharyngeal flora and the host immune system may lead to future advances in the therapeutic management of chronic lung infections.",

Evidence is emerging that microRNAs are key mediators of the host response to infection, predominantly by regulating proteins involved in innate and adaptive immune pathways. MicroRNAs can govern the cellular tropism of some viruses, are implicated in the resistance of some individuals to infections like HIV, and are associated with impaired vaccine response in older people. Not surprisingly, pathogens have evolved ways to undermine the effects of microRNAs on immunity. Recognition of this has led to new experimental treatments, RG-101 and Miravirsen \u2013 hepatitis C treatments which target host microRNA. MicroRNAs are being investigated as novel infection biomarkers, and they are being used to design attenuated vaccines e.g. against Dengue virus. This comprehensive review synthesises current knowledge of microRNA in host response to infection with emphasis on potential clinical applications, along with an evaluation of the challenges still to be overcome.",

These consensus guidelines recommend an AUC/MIC ratio of 400\u2013600 mg*hour/L (assuming a broth microdilution MIC of 1 mg/L) to achieve clinical efficacy and ensure safety for patients being treated for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.",

Analysis of the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON) database quantitatively illustrates that the globalization of human infectious agents depends significantly on the range of hosts used. Infectious agents specific to humans are broadly and uniformly distributed, whereas zoonotic infectious agents are far more localized in their geographical distribution. Moreover, these patterns vary depending on transmission mode and infectious agent taxonomy. This dichotomy is unlikely to persist if certain aspects of globalization (for example, exotic species introductions) continue unabated. This raises a serious concern for public health and leaves nations with the task of determining the infectious agents that have the greatest potential to establish within their borders. At the advent of a century characterized by an apparent increase in emerging infectious diseases, these results have critical implications for public-health policy and future research pathways of infectious disease ecology.",

    "abstract_text": "In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.",

Furthermore, all available predictive models for the UK indicate that the climate is likely to change further and feature more extreme weather events and a trend towards wetter, milder winters and hotter, drier summers. These changes will alter the prevalence of endemic diseases spatially and/or temporally and impact on animal health and welfare. Most notable among these endemic parasites are the helminths, which have been shown to be very strongly influenced by both the short-term weather and climate through effects on their free-living larval stages on pasture. In this review, we examine recent trends in prevalence and epidemiology of key helminth species and consider whether these could be climate-related. We identify likely effects of temperature and rainfall on the free-living stages and some key parasite traits likely to determine parasite abundance under changed climatic conditions. We find clear evidence that climate change, especially elevated temperature, has already changed the overall abundance, seasonality and spatial spread of endemic helminths in the UK. We explore some confounders and alternative explanations for the observed patterns. Finally, we explore the implications of these findings for policy makers and the livestock industry and make some recommendations for future research priorities.",

Climate change, the introduction of invasive species, urbanization, agricultural practices and the loss of biodiversity have all been implicated in increasing the spread of infectious pathogens. In many regards, deforestation supersedes these other global events in terms of its immediate potential global effects in both tropical and temperate regions. The effects of deforestation on the spread of pathogens in birds are largely unknown. Birds harbor many of the same types of pathogens as humans and in addition can spread infectious agents to humans and other wildlife. It is thought that avifauna have gone extinct due to infectious diseases and many are presently threatened, especially endemic island birds. It is clear that habitat degradation can pose a direct threat to many bird species but it is uncertain how these alterations will affect disease transmission and susceptibility to disease. The migration and dispersal of birds can also change with habitat degradation, and thus expose populations to novel pathogens. Some recent work has shown that the results of landscape transformation can have confounding effects on avian malaria, other haemosporidian parasites and viruses. Now with advances in many technologies, including mathematical and computer modeling, genomics and satellite tracking, scientists have tools to further research the disease ecology of deforestation. This research will be imperative to help predict and prevent outbreaks that could affect avifauna, humans and other wildlife worldwide.",

The ability to analyze microbial communities without culturing organisms has created the ever-growing field of metagenomics and microbiome analysis and has generated significant new insights into the relation between host and microbe. The medical literature contains many examples of how this new technology can be used for infectious disease diagnostics and pathogen analysis. The implementation of NGS in medical practice has been a slow process due to various challenges such as clinical trials, lack of applicable regulatory guidelines, and the adaptation of the technology to the clinical environment.

Quantifying infectious disease-relevant travel patterns on fine spatial and temporal scales has historically been limited by data availability. The recent emergence of mobile phone calling data and associated locational information means that we can now trace fine scale movement across large numbers of individuals. However, these data necessarily reflect a biased sample of individuals across communities and are generally aggregated for both ethical and pragmatic reasons that may further obscure the nuance of individual and spatial heterogeneities. Additionally, as a general rule, the mobile phone data are not linked to demographic or social identifiers, or to information about the disease status of individual subscribers (although these may be made available in smaller-scale specific cases). Combining data on human movement from mobile phone data-derived population fluxes with data on disease incidence requires approaches that can tackle varying spatial and temporal resolutions of each data source and generate inference about dynamics on scales relevant to both pathogen biology and human ecology. Here, we review the opportunities and challenges of these novel data streams, illustrating our examples with analyses of 2 different pathogens in Kenya, and conclude by outlining core directions for future research.",

It is sensed by the P2X7 receptor, the expression of which is upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Activation of the P2X7 receptor opens a cation-specific channel that alters the ionic environment of the cell, activating several pathways, including (i) the inflammasome, leading to production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18; (ii) the stress-activated protein kinase pathway, resulting in apoptosis; (iii) the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, leading to generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates; and (iv) phospholipase D, stimulating phagosome-lysosome fusion. The P2X7 receptor can initiate host mechanisms to remove pathogens, most particularly those that parasitise macrophages. At the same time, the P2X7 receptor may be subverted by pathogens to modulate host responses. Moreover, recent genetic studies have demonstrated significant associations between susceptibility or resistance to parasites and bacteria, and loss-of-function or gain-of-function polymorphisms in the P2X7 receptor, underscoring its importance in infectious disease.",

    "abstract_text": "Emerging infectious diseases are increasingly cited as threats to wildlife, livestock and humans alike. They can threaten geographically isolated or critically endangered wildlife populations; however, relatively few studies have clearly demonstrated the extent to which emerging diseases can impact populations of common wildlife species. Here, we report the impact of an emerging protozoal disease on British populations of greenfinch Carduelis chloris and chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, two of the most common birds in Britain. Morphological and molecular analyses showed this to be due to Trichomonas gallinae. Trichomonosis emerged as a novel fatal disease of finches in Britain in 2005 and rapidly became epidemic within greenfinch, and to a lesser extent chaffinch, populations in 2006. By 2007, breeding populations of greenfinches and chaffinches in the geographic region of highest disease incidence had decreased by 35% and 21% respectively, representing mortality in excess of half a million birds. In contrast, declines were less pronounced or absent in these species in regions where the disease was found in intermediate or low incidence. Also, populations of dunnock Prunella modularis, which similarly feeds in gardens, but in which T. gallinae was rarely recorded, did not decline. This is the first trichomonosis epidemic reported in the scientific literature to negatively impact populations of free-ranging non-columbiform species, and such levels of mortality and decline due to an emerging infectious disease are unprecedented in British wild bird populations. This disease emergence event demonstrates the potential for a protozoan parasite to jump avian host taxonomic groups with dramatic effect over a short time period.",

    "abstract_text": "Emerging infectious diseases have taken on renewed significance in the public health sector since the 1990s. Worldwide, governments are preparing emergency plans to guide them; their plans acknowledge that communication will be vital in the event of an outbreak. However, much of the emerging infectious disease communication literature deals with one-way transmission of facts to the public by experts. Little attention is paid to how differently various groups conceptualize risk, or to the idea that there is more to communication than the intentional transfer of information. Emerging infectious disease communication is often based in traditional health promotion or emergency/crisis communication literature, where it is assumed that the only 'enemy' is the disease, the right course of action is obvious and the expertise (coming from a public health assumed to be value-free) will not be questioned. Research tends to be limited to exploring barriers to understanding or education, to facilitate better message development. Emerging infectious disease communication research should be broadened to include exploration of implicit assumptions about the nature of the problem at hand (and how to deal with it) as well as the concepts of uncertainty, trust, power, values and biases. Recent risk communication theory, whose focus has historically been on more obviously controversial technological/environmental situations, should guide such research, as it would highlight important contextual factors in which to embed emerging infectious disease communication. This article reviews existing emerging infectious disease communications literature, discusses risk communications theories that could broaden emerging infectious disease communication research, and suggests next steps in a research agenda.",

A good evidence base for such values is essential, because they allow investigators to identify epidemiologic links between cases and serve as an important parameter in epidemic transmission models used to design infection control strategies. We reviewed the literature for available data sets containing serial intervals and for reported values of serial intervals. We were able to collect data on outbreaks within households, which we reanalyzed to infer a mean serial interval using a common statistical method. We estimated the mean serial intervals for influenza A(H3N2) (2.2 days), pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (2.8 days), respiratory syncytial virus (7.5 days), measles (11.7 days), varicella (14.0 days), smallpox (17.7 days), mumps (18.0 days), rubella (18.3 days), and pertussis (22.8 days). For varicella, we found an evidence-based value that deviates substantially from the 21 days commonly used in transmission models. This value of the serial interval for pertussis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first that is based on observations. Our review reveals that, for most infectious diseases, there is very limited evidence to support the serial intervals that are often cited.",

Work in many laboratories is focusing on the specific contributions of the adipocyte in the areas of metabolism, inflammation, and cancer in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the systemic influence of the adipocyte under normal and pathophysiological conditions. Until recently, adipose tissue has been considered to be a mere storage compartment of triglycerides. It is now clear that adipocytes are highly active endocrine cells that play a central role in overall energy homeostasis and are important contributors to some aspects of the immune system. They do so not only by influencing systemic lipid homeostasis but also through the production and release of a host of adipocyte-specific and adipocyte-enriched hormonal factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix components (commonly referred to as \u201cadipokines\u201d). Little attention has been given to the role of adipose tissue in infectious disease. However, the strong proinflammatory potential of adipose tissue suggests an important role in the systemic innate immune response. Furthermore, the adipocyte proper serves as an important target for the intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the cause of Chagas\u2019 disease. In chronic Chagas\u2019 disease, adipocytes may represent an important long-term reservoir for parasites from which relapse of infection can occur. In other cases, such as with certain subtypes of adenoviruses, infection with viral particles leads to long-term hyperplasia and hyperproliferation of adipocytes, associating these adenoviral infections with a high propensity for subsequent obesity. Here, we discuss briefly the systemic contributions of adipose tissue to the inflammatory response to infection and provide a brief overview of infectious agents that have a specific impact on adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is composed of many different cell types, but adipocytes are among the most predominant cells. Since different adipose tissue depots show distinct gene expression patterns and vary widely in size and proximity to neighboring organs, individual depots could be viewed as \u201cmini-organs.\u201d Despite differences between the different pads, the depots share similarity with respect to their ability to store lipids and secrete adipose tissue-derived hormones. Adipose tissue stores lipid in the form of triglycerides and cholesterol esters within the lipid droplets that represent specialized organelles inside the adipocyte. Since the lipid droplet is such a large component of the adipocyte (95% of the mass of the adipocyte), changes in the amount of lipid stored within the adipocyte affect fat cell size (ranging from 25 to 250 m). Due to the enormous size of the lipid droplet within a normal adipocyte, these cells were viewed originally merely as lipid storage cells. However, it is now known that adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ regulating a variety of physiological functions, placing the study of adipokines, or adipose tissue-derived secretory products, at the forefront of research in the field of adipose tissue biology.",

    "abstract_text": "The previous chapter considered how short-term variations in climatic conditions and extreme weather events can exert direct effects on human death rates, physical injury, mental health and other health outcomes. Changes in mean climatic conditions and climate variability also can affect human health via indirect pathways, particularly via changes in biological and ecological processes that influence infectious disease transmission and food yields. This chapter examines the influences of climatic factors on infectious diseases. For centuries humans have known that climatic conditions affect epidemic infections\u2014since well before the basic notion of infectious agents was understood late in the nineteenth century. The Roman aristocracy took refuge in their hill resorts each summer to avoid malaria. South Asians learnt early that in high summer, strongly curried foods were less prone to induce diarrhoeal diseases. In the southern United States one of the most severe summertime outbreaks of yellow fever (viral disease transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito) occurred in 1878, during one of the strongest El Nino episodes on record. The economic and human cost was enormous, with an estimated death toll of around 20000 people. In developed countries today it is well known that recurrent influenza epidemics occur in mid-winter. Infectious disease transmission should be viewed within an ecological framework. Infectious agents obtain the necessary nutrients and energy by parasitization of higher organisms. Most such infections are benign, and some are even beneficial to both host and microbe. Only a minority of infections that adversely affect the host\u2019s biology are termed \u201cinfectious disease\u201d. During the long processes of human cultural evolution; population dispersal around the world; and subsequent inter-population contact and conflict; several distinct transitions in human ecology and inter-population interactions have changed profoundly the patterns of infectious disease in human populations. Since the early emergence of agriculture and livestock herding around 10000 years ago, three great transitions in human/microbe relationships are readily recognizable (1):",

We also explore the market dynamics that encourage the use of molecular pharming, particularly for pharmaceuticals that are required in small amounts (such as personalized medicines) or large amounts (on a multi-ton scale, such as blood products and microbicides) and those that are needed in response to emergency situations (pandemics and bioterrorism). The impact of molecular pharming will increase as the platforms become standardized and optimized through adoption of good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards for clinical development, offering a new opportunity to produce inexpensive medicines in regional markets that are typically excluded under current business models.",

Loss of animal and plant species, many not yet known to science, is just one among many negative consequences of Amazon deforestation. Deforestation affects indigenous communities, riverside as well as urban populations, and even planetary health. Amazonia has a prominent role in regulating the Earth's climate, with forest loss contributing to rising regional and global temperatures and intensification of extreme weather events. These climatic conditions are important drivers of emerging infectious diseases, and activities associated with deforestation contribute to the spread of disease vectors. This review presents the main impacts of Amazon deforestation on infectious-disease dynamics and public health from a One Health perspective. Because Brazil holds the largest area of Amazon rainforest, emphasis is given to the Brazilian scenario. Finally, potential solutions to mitigate deforestation and emerging infectious diseases are presented from the perspectives of researchers in different fields.",

Once an emerging epidemic is detected, public health authorities will attempt to mitigate the epidemic by, among other measures, reducing further spread as much as possible. Scarce and/or costly control measures such as vaccines, anti-infective drugs, and social distancing must be allocated while epidemiological characteristics of the disease remain uncertain. Here we present first principles for allocating scarce resources with limited data. We show that under a broad class of assumptions, the simple rule of targeting intervention measures at the group with the highest risk of infection per individual will achieve the largest reduction in the transmission potential of a novel infection. For vaccination of susceptible persons, the appropriate risk measure is force of infection; for social distancing, the appropriate risk measure is incidence of infection. Unlike existing methods that rely on detailed knowledge of group-specific transmission rates, the method described here can be implemented using only data that are readily available during an epidemic, and allows ready adaptation as the epidemic progresses. The need to observe risk of infection helps to focus the ongoing planning and design of new infectious disease surveillance programs; from the presented first principles for allocating scarce resources, we can adjust the prioritization of groups for intervention when new observations on an emerging epidemic become available.",

In the case of mammals, however, there are still no well-corroborated instances of such diseases having caused or significantly contributed to the complete collapse of species. A case in point is the extinction of the endemic Christmas Island rat (Rattus macleari): although it has been argued that its disappearance ca. AD 1900 may have been partly or wholly caused by a pathogenic trypanosome carried by fleas hosted on recently-introduced black rats (Rattus rattus), no decisive evidence for this scenario has ever been adduced. Using ancient DNA methods on samples from museum specimens of these rodents collected during the extinction window (AD 1888\u20131908), we were able to resolve unambiguously sequence evidence of murid trypanosomes in both endemic and invasive rats. Importantly, endemic rats collected prior to the introduction of black rats were devoid of trypanosome signal. Hybridization between endemic and black rats was also previously hypothesized, but we found no evidence of this in examined specimens, and conclude that hybridization cannot account for the disappearance of the endemic species. This is the first molecular evidence for a pathogen emerging in a na\u00efve mammal species immediately prior to its final collapse.",

    "abstract_text": "This review examines the available studies bearing on the relation between infant-feeding mode and infectious illness in the populations of less-developed countries. A companion critical review of studies of the relationship of infant-feeding methods and infection in industrialized countries has concluded that, although laboratory studies provide biologic plausibility for a lower infection rate in breast-fed infants, an effect, if present, is apparently modest.39 The strongest evidence for a protective effect of breast-feeding in industrialized countries is for gastrointestinal (diarrheal) illness. In this review of studies among populations in developing countries we found the evidence for an important protective effect of breast-feeding against infectious illness to be much stronger. This conclusion was reached despite serious problems in the design of many of the studies reviewed. One characteristic that distinguishes populations in less-developed countries from those of industrialized ones is the infant mortality. Even today, infant mortality for much of the world is up to ten times higher than infant mortality in the United States and Northern Europe.46 This undoubtedly reflects differences in sanitation, nutrition, housing, and other indicators of socioeconomic status. Much of the difference in rates of infant and child mortality and morbidity is attributable to high rates of infectious illness, especially gastrointestinal disease. Thus, in these populations, the positive effects of breast-feeding are of greater potential importance for the health of the infant population and should be easier to detect in clinical and epidemiologic studies. In this review we will address the following key questions: (1) whether the method of infant feeding (breast v other) is associated with differences in rates of mortality, both overall and infectious, and in rates of infectious morbidity in less-developed countries;",

His collected works include various references to infectious diseases that range from general observations on the nature of infection, hygiene, epidemiology, and the immune response, to detailed descriptions of syndromes such as tuberculous spondylitis, malaria, and tetanus. We sought to evaluate the extent to which this historical information has influenced the modern relevant literature. Associating disease to the disequilibrium of body fluids may seem an ancient and outdated notion nowadays, but many of the clinical descriptions presented in the Corpus Hippocraticum (Hippocratic Collection) are still the archetypes of the natural history of certain infectious diseases and their collective interplay with the environment, climate, and society. For this reason, modern clinicians and researchers continue to be attracted to these 'lessons' from the past - lessons that remain extremely valuable.",

Careful compliance with established hygiene practices by healthcare workers together with effective antiseptic options is essential for the protection of patients from infectious agents. For over 60 years, povidone iodine (PVP-I) formulations have been shown to limit the impact and spread of infectious diseases with potent antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal effects. In addition to a lack of reported resistance, the benefits of PVP-I include an excellent safety profile and a broad spectrum of effect due to its multimodal action. Studies have shown that hand washing with PVP-I-based antiseptics is effective for the decontamination of skin, while PVP-I mouthwashes and gargles significantly reduce viral load in the oral cavity and the oropharynx. The importance of PVP-I has been emphasised by its inclusion in the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines, and high potency for virucidal activity has been observed against viruses of significant global concern, including hepatitis A and influenza, as well as the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome and Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses. Together with its diverse applications in antimicrobial control, broad accessibility across the globe, and outstanding safety and tolerability profile, PVP-I offers an affordable, potent, and widely available antiseptic option.

Human brucellosis can be treated with a combination of antibiotics but is very difficult to diagnose and requires laboratory testing for confirmation. Only a few recent studies have addressed the prevalence and importance of brucellosis as a human disease problem in India.

We tested this thermal mismatch hypothesis by quantifying the temperature\u2010dependent susceptibility of cold\u2010 and warm\u2010adapted amphibian species to the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ( Bd ) using laboratory experiments and field prevalence estimates from 15 410 individuals in 598 populations. In both the laboratory and field, we found that the greatest susceptibility of cold\u2010 and warm\u2010adapted hosts occurred at relatively warm and cool temperatures, respectively, providing support for the thermal mismatch hypothesis . Our results suggest that as climate change shifts hosts away from their optimal temperatures, the probability of increased host susceptibility to infectious disease might increase, but the effect will depend on the host species and the direction of the climate shift. Our findings help explain the tremendous variation in species responses to Bd across climates and spatial, temporal and species\u2010level variation in disease outbreaks associated with extreme weather events that are becoming more common with climate change.",

    "abstract_text": "School environments are thought to play an important role in the community spread of infectious diseases such as influenza because of the high mixing rates of school children. The closure of schools has therefore been proposed as an efficient mitigation strategy. Such measures come however with high associated social and economic costs, making alternative, less disruptive interventions highly desirable. The recent availability of high-resolution contact network data from school environments provides an opportunity to design models of micro-interventions and compare the outcomes of alternative mitigation measures. We model mitigation measures that involve the targeted closure of school classes or grades based on readily available information such as the number of symptomatic infectious children in a class. We focus on the specific case of a primary school for which we have high-resolution data on the close-range interactions of children and teachers. We simulate the spread of an influenza-like illness in this population by using an SEIR model with asymptomatics, and compare the outcomes of different mitigation strategies. We find that targeted class closure affords strong mitigation effects: closing a class for a fixed period of time \u2013 equal to the sum of the average infectious and latent durations \u2013 whenever two infectious individuals are detected in that class decreases the attack rate by almost 70% and significantly decreases the probability of a severe outbreak. The closure of all classes of the same grade mitigates the spread almost as much as closing the whole school. Our model of targeted class closure strategies based on readily available information on symptomatic subjects and on limited information on mixing patterns, such as the grade structure of the school, shows that these strategies might be almost as effective as whole-school closure, at a much lower cost. This may inform public health policies for the management and mitigation of influenza-like outbreaks in the community.",

    "abstract_text": "Chytridiomycosis is an emerging infectious disease that has recently been reported in amphibian populations throughout the world. It has been associated with many cases of population declines and extinctions. In some areas of the Sierra Nevada of California the disease appears to be the causal factor in the rapid extinction of local populations of the mountain yellow-legged frog, Rana muscosa, within a few years of the first detection of the disease. In other areas, however, R. muscosa populations appear to persist for many years, despite high levels of infection in tadpoles. Here we present simple models of the dynamics of the disease within an individual lake and ask whether our current understanding of the disease is consistent with the field survey observations of: (a) extinction due to the disease over a wide range of host population sizes, and (b) persistence of frog populations with the disease at some sites. Despite our laboratory observation of chytridiomycosis being invariably lethal to postmetamorphic frogs, the observed long-term persistence of infected frog populations can only be explained if at least some infected adult frogs survive and reproduce.",

DESIGN--Follow up by postal questionnaire six weeks to four years (median 1 year) after initial clinical assessment of patients referred to hospital during 1984-8. SETTING--Infectious diseases outpatient clinic in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--200 consecutive patients with fatigue of uncertain cause for at least six weeks; 177 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Findings at initial assessment; current symptoms, beliefs about the cause of illness, coping behaviours emotional disorder, social variables including membership of self help organizations, and degrees of recovery and functional impairment from questionnaire responses. RESULTS--144 (81%) patients returned completed questionnaires. Initial assessment did not indicate the cause of fatigue, other than preceding infection. The proportion of patients with functional impairment was significantly smaller with longer follow up (33% (11/33) at two to four years, 73% (29/40) at six weeks to six months; chi 2 for trend = 12.5, df = 1; p less than 0.05). Functional impairment was significantly associated with belief in a viral cause of the illness (odds ratio = 3.9; 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 9.9), limiting exercise (3.2; 1.5 to 6.6), avoiding alcohol (4.5; 1.8 to 11.3), changing or leaving employment (3.1; 1.4 to 6.9), belonging to a self help organization (7.8; 2.5 to 23.9), and current emotional disorder (4.4; 2.0 to 9.3). CONCLUSIONS--Short term prognosis for recovery of function was poor but improved with time. Most patients had made a functional recovery by two years after initial clinic attendance. Impaired functioning was more likely with certain patient characteristics. Prospective studies are required to clarify whether these associations are the consequences of a more disabling illness or indicate factors contributing to impaired function.",

A systematic review was performed including randomized controlled trials and observational studies, examining different antibiotic treatment regimens for the targeted treatment of infections caused by the 3GCephRE, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Treatments were classified as head-to-head comparisons between individual antibiotics and between monotherapy and combination therapy regimens, including defined monotherapy and combination regimens only. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, preferably at 30 days and secondary outcomes included clinical failure, microbiological failure, development of resistance, relapse/recurrence, adverse events and length of hospital stay. The last search of all databases was conducted in December 2019, followed by a focused search for relevant studies up until ECCMID 2021. Data were summarized narratively. The certainty of the evidence for each comparison between antibiotics and between monotherapy and combination therapy regimens was classified by the GRADE recommendations. The strength of the recommendations for or against treatments was classified as strong or conditional (weak).RecommendationsThe guideline panel reviewed the evidence per pathogen, preferably per site of infection, critically appraising the existing studies. Many of the comparisons were addressed in small observational studies at high risk of bias only. Notably, there was very little evidence on the effects of the new, recently approved, \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors on infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Most recommendations are based on very-low- and low-certainty evidence. A high value was placed on antibiotic stewardship considerations in all recommendations, searching for carbapenem-sparing options for 3GCephRE and limiting the recommendations of the new antibiotics for severe infections, as defined by the sepsis-3 criteria.

In this statement, the American Thoracic Society (ATS), CDC, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) propose recommendations to improve the control and prevention of TB in the United States and to progress toward its elimination. This statement is one in a series issued periodically by the sponsoring organizations to guide the diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention of TB. This statement supersedes the previous statement by ATS and CDC, which was also supported by IDSA and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). This statement was drafted, after an evidence-based review of the subject, by a panel of representatives of the three sponsoring organizations. AAP, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association, and the Canadian Thoracic Society were also represented on the panel. This statement integrates recent scientific advances with current epidemiologic data, other recent guidelines from this series, and other sources into a coherent and practical approach to the control of TB in the United States. Although drafted to apply to TB control activities in the United States, this statement might be of use in other countries in which persons with TB generally have access to medical and public health services and resources necessary to make a precise diagnosis of the disease; achieve curative medical treatment; and otherwise provide substantial science-based protection of the population against TB. This statement is aimed at all persons who advocate, plan, and work at controlling and preventing TB in the United States, including persons who formulate public health policy and make decisions about allocation of resources for disease control and health maintenance and directors and staff members of state, county, and local public health agencies throughout the United States charged with control of TB.

    "abstract_text": "BACKGROUND: Analytical studies of reportable infectious diseases often use the small minority of cases detected through surveillance systems. For many diseases, notification of cases represents a non-random selection process. Apparent differences in exposure histories may be due to biases involved in the surveillance system selection of cases compared to randomly selected controls. In addition, differential recall between cases and controls may occur. One way to avoid these problems is to compare cases with another group of cases with a different disorder selected by a similar surveillance system, although this can introduce new biases. METHODS: In infectious diseases cases with the same disease can be divided into aetiologically meaningful subgroups by subtyping the pathogen. Exposure history can then be compared between these subgroups. RESULTS: Several biases are removed. The control group composed of other cases does not represent the exposure history of the study base but differs from it in a predictable and useful way. People considered as controls will have a higher incidence of general predisposing factors than the general population. Analysis is limited to factors associated with exposure to the infecting agent. CONCLUSIONS: Case-case comparison is a development of case-control methodology made possible by laboratory typing techniques. These comparisons allow a more restricted but more refined analysis of the association of some exposures with infection. Determination of how exposure to the infectious agent occurred is more efficient and unbiased than in standard case-control studies but general factors determining whether disease occurs after an infectious exposure can not be studied.",

From a statistical perspective, their prediction is complicated by the fact that no two epidemics are identical due to changing contact habits, mutations of infectious agents, and changing human and animal behaviour in response to the presence of an epidemic. Thus model parameters governing infectious mechanisms will typically be unknown. On the other hand, epidemic control strategies need to be decided rapidly as data accumulate. In this paper we present a fully Bayesian methodology for performing inference and online prediction for epidemics in structured populations. Key features of our approach are the development of an MCMC- (and adaptive MCMC-) based methodology for parameter estimation, epidemic prediction, and online assessment of risk from currently unobserved infections. We illustrate our methods using two complementary studies: an analysis of the 2001 UK Foot and Mouth epidemic, and modelling the potential risk from a possible future Avian Influenza epidemic to the UK Poultry industry.",

    "abstract_text": "The emergence of co-infections and the evolution of drug-resistant pathogens limit the utility of current therapies against infections, and developing countries in particular are facing a great challenge in combating infectious disease. Moreover, any failure to control the spread of infectious diseases would also represent a threat to developed countries. Recent developments in nanotechnology allow us to address this issue at two levels: diagnostics and treatment. Prevention of the spread of infectious pathogens requires rapid and accurate identification of the infectious agents for proper treatment. Recently developed fluorescent nanoparticles are so sensitive that even a single nanoparticle is capable of emitting a strong enough signal to be captured, thus enabling early identification of infections. Proper and effective treatment not only saves the patient, but also prevents the spread of the pathogens. Specific nanoparticle vehicles developed to encapsulate therapeutic agents and deliver them to a target site represent a promising strategy to boost immune responses for vaccination and boost the efficacy of drugs for treatment. Here, we describe a variety of nanotechnologies for use in applications such as immune response modulation, drug delivery, diagnostics, and treatment, which are especially needed in developing countries.",

Peptide transport was determined by incubating ganglia with 35S-methionine and measuring the appearance of labeled peptides in connected ganglia. Selected interganglionic connectives were left intact and passed through a diffusion barrier separating the ganglia. Labeled peptides transported between ganglia included FMRFamide, myomodulin, and pedal peptide. Each of these peptides has been shown to be physiologically active in Aplysia. In addition to these previously characterized neuropeptides, a number of other as yet uncharacterized labeled peptides were also transported. All the peptides were transported by fast axonal transport as judged by the distance transported and/or the sensitivity to colchicine. Overall, FMRFamide and several unidentified peptides were the predominant transported peptides. However, the nature and amount of the peptides transported differed for each ganglia. These results support the proposition that the labeled peptides have transmitterlike actions and suggest that there are a number of neuropeptides that are likely to have central actions that have not yet been characterized in Aplysia.",

The aims of the study were to determine if clinical and clinicopathologic data (not including biopsy or necropsy examination) could distinguish inflammatory CNS diseases from diseases of other types, and to search for criteria allowing differentiation of specific inflammatory diseases. The signalment, historical findings, extraneural and neurological signs, and the lesion site contributed marginally to a specific diagnosis. Multifocal signs were only noticed in one third of the dogs with inflammatory/infectious diseases. Particular neurological abnormalities were more frequent in certain diseases than in others (eg, myoclonus was frequent in dogs with distemper, but it was also found in those with other meningoencephalomyelitides). Hematologic findings contributed to the diagnosis in certain conditions (eg, canine distemper encephalitis, protozoal encephalomyelitis, steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis). Cerebrospinal fluid examinations, including immunoglobulin G index and cytology were useful to separate meningoencephalomyelitides from the other CNS diseases and to distinguish certain conditions from others. In most cases a specific diagnosis depended on a combination of clinical signs and ancillary diagnostic aids. Still, a specific diagnosis remained very difficult, if not impossible, in at least one third of the dogs.",

We show that human infectious diseases exhibit striking biogeographic grouping patterns at a global scale, reminiscent of \u201cWallacean\u201d zoogeographic patterns. This result is surprising, given the global distribution and unprecedented connectivity of humans as hosts and the homogenizing forces of globalization; despite these factors, infectious disease assemblages remain fundamentally constrained in their distributions by ecological barriers to dispersal or establishment. Biogeographic processes thus appear to provide an overarching context in which other factors promoting infectious disease emergence and spread are set. We use outbreaks of Ebola virus to illustrate how such patterns could be leveraged to provide a \u201chead start\u201d or added focus for risk management activities.",

These therapeutic antibodies (ThAb) may be especially important for infectious diseases in which there is antibiotic resistance, toxin-mediated pathogenesis, or for emerging pathogens. The unique structure of antibodies determines the specific nature of the effector function, so when developing ThAb, the desired effector functions need to be considered and integrated into the design and development processes to ensure maximum efficacy and safety. Antibody subclass is a critical consideration, but it is noteworthy that almost all ThAb that are licenced or currently in development utilise an IgG1 backbone. This review outlines the major structural properties that vary across subclasses, how these properties affect functional immunity, and discusses the various approaches used to study subclass responses to infectious diseases. We also review the factors associated with the selection of antibody subclasses when designing ThAb and highlight circumstances where different subclass properties might be beneficial when applied to particular infectious diseases. These approaches are critical to the future design of ThAb and to the study of naturally-acquired and vaccine-induced immunity.",

In this regard, a Joint FAO/IAEA Meeting of Consultants was convened in Vienna in January 1992 to review aspects of ELISA data expression, primary reference standards, quality assurance and diagnostic validation.

To alter their host range pathogens require adaptations, which ensure their circulation in a new animal population. Adaptations for circulation in different populations of vertebrate hosts seem to have been acquired multiple times within the genus Salmonella because extant Salmonella serotypes differ greatly with regard to host range. In this article, mechanisms involved in host adaptation are deduced by considering the influence of the host immune response on circulation of Salmonella serotypes within populations of vertebrate animals. This approach contributes to the identification of genes involved in host adaptation and provides new insights into the emergence of food\u2010borne pathogens.",

To improve public health surveillance and, ultimately, interventions, we examined 3 primary systems that process event-based outbreak information: Global Public Health Intelligence Network, HealthMap, and EpiSPIDER. Despite similarities among them, these systems are highly complementary because they monitor different data types, rely on varying levels of automation and human analysis, and distribute distinct information. Future development should focus on linking these systems more closely to public health practitioners in the field and establishing collaborative networks for alert verification and dissemination. Such development would further establish event-based monitoring as an invaluable public health resource that provides critical context and an alternative to traditional indicator-based outbreak reporting.",

    "abstract_text": "Modern vaccines have largely shifted from using whole, killed or attenuated pathogens to being based on subunit components. Since this diminishes immunogenicity, vaccine adjuvants that enhance the immune response to purified antigens are critically needed. Further advantages of adjuvants include dose sparing, increased vaccine efficacy in immunocompromised individuals and the potential to protect against highly variable pathogens by broadening the immune response. Due to their ability to link the innate with the adaptive immune response, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists are highly promising as adjuvants in vaccines against life-threatening and complex diseases such as cancer, AIDS and malaria. TLRs are transmembrane receptors, which are predominantly expressed by innate immune cells. They can be classified into cell surface (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6) and intracellular TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9), expressed on endosomal membranes. Besides a transmembrane domain, each TLR possesses a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) segment that mediates PAMP/DAMP recognition and a TIR domain that delivers the downstream signal transduction and initiates an inflammatory response. Thus, TLRs are excellent targets for adjuvants to provide a \"danger\" signal to induce an effective immune response that leads to long-lasting protection. The present review will elaborate on applications of TLR ligands as vaccine adjuvants and immunotherapeutic agents, with a focus on clinically relevant adjuvants.",

    "abstract_text": "Zoonotic infectious diseases have been an important concern to humankind for more than 10,000 years. Today, approximately 75% of newly emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonoses that result from various anthropogenic, genetic, ecologic, socioeconomic, and climatic factors. These interrelated driving forces make it difficult to predict and to prevent zoonotic EIDs. Although significant improvements in environmental and medical surveillance, clinical diagnostic methods, and medical practices have been achieved in the recent years, zoonotic EIDs remain a major global concern, and such threats are expanding, especially in less developed regions. The current Ebola epidemic in West Africa is an extreme stark reminder of the role animal reservoirs play in public health and reinforces the urgent need for globally operationalizing a One Health approach. The complex nature of zoonotic diseases and the limited resources in developing countries are a reminder that the need for implementation of Global One Health in low-resource settings is crucial. The Veterinary Public Health and Biotechnology (VPH-Biotec) Global Consortium launched the International Congress on Pathogens at the Human-Animal Interface (ICOPHAI) in order to address important challenges and needs for capacity building. The inaugural ICOPHAI (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2011) and the second congress (Porto de Galinhas, Brazil, 2013) were unique opportunities to share and discuss issues related to zoonotic infectious diseases worldwide. In addition to strong scientific reports in eight thematic areas that necessitate One Health implementation, the congress identified four key capacity-building needs: (1) development of adequate science-based risk management policies, (2) skilled-personnel capacity building, (3) accredited veterinary and public health diagnostic laboratories with a shared database, and (4) improved use of existing natural resources and implementation. The aim of this review is to highlight advances in key zoonotic disease areas and the One Health capacity needs.",

Animal models play an essential role in the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents but large numbers of animals are required to obtain quantitative microbiological data by tissue sampling. Biophotonic imaging (BPI) is a highly sensitive, nontoxic technique based on the detection of visible light, produced by luciferase-catalysed reactions (bioluminescence) or by excitation of fluorescent molecules, using sensitive photon detectors. The development of bioluminescent/fluorescent microorganisms therefore allows the real-time noninvasive detection of microorganisms within intact living animals. Multiple imaging of the same animal throughout an experiment allows disease progression to be followed with extreme accuracy, reducing the number of animals required to yield statistically meaningful data. In the study of infectious disease, the use of BPI is becoming widespread due to the novel insights it can provide into established models, as well as the impact of the technique on two of the guiding principles of using animals in research, namely reduction and refinement. Here, we review the technology of BPI, from the instrumentation through to the generation of a photonic signal, and illustrate how the technique is shedding light on infection dynamics in vivo.",

    "abstract_text": "The common occurrence and dire consequences of infectious disease outbreaks in nursing homes often go unrecognized and unappreciated. Nevertheless, these facilities provide an ideal environment for acquisition and spread of infection: susceptible residents who share sources of air, food, water, and health care in a crowded institutional setting. Moreover, visitors, staff, and residents constantly come and go, bringing in pathogens from both the hospital and the community. Outbreaks of respiratory and gastrointestinal infection predominate in this setting, but outbreaks of skin and soft-tissue infection and infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria also occur with some frequency.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract Emerging diseases are impacting animals under high\u2010density culture, yet few studies assess their importance to wild populations. Microparasites selected for enhanced virulence in culture settings should be less successful maintaining infectivity in wild populations, as once the host dies, there are limited opportunities to infect new individuals. Instead, moderately virulent microparasites persisting for long periods across multiple environments are of greatest concern. Evolved resistance to endemic microparasites may reduce susceptibilities, but as barriers to microparasite distributions are weakened, and environments become more stressful, unexposed populations may be impacted and pathogenicity enhanced. We provide an overview of the evolutionary and ecological impacts of infectious diseases in wild salmon and suggest ways in which modern technologies can elucidate the microparasites of greatest potential import. We present four case studies that resolve microparasite impacts on adult salmon migration success, impact of river warming on microparasite replication, and infection status on susceptibility to predation. Future health of wild salmon must be considered in a holistic context that includes the cumulative or synergistic impacts of multiple stressors. These approaches will identify populations at greatest risk, critically needed to manage and potentially ameliorate the shifts in current or future trajectories of wild populations.",

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY Xenotransplantation, the transplantation of living organs, tissues, or cells from one species to another, is viewed as a potential solution to the existing shortage of human organs for transplantation. While whole-organ xenotransplantation is still in the preclinical stage, cellular xenotransplantation and extracorporeal perfusion applications are showing promise in early clinical trials. Advances in immunosuppressive therapy, gene engineering, and cloning of animals bring a broader array of xenotransplantation protocols closer to clinical trials. Despite several potential advantages over allotransplantation, xenotransplantation encompasses a number of problems. Immunologic rejection remains the primary hindrance. The potential to introduce infections across species barriers, another major concern, is the main focus of this review. Nonhuman primates are unlikely to be a main source for xenotransplantation products despite their phylogenetic proximity to humans. Genetically engineered pigs, bred under special conditions, are currently envisaged as the major source. Thus far, there has been no evidence for human infections caused by pig xenotransplantation products. However, the existence of xenotropic endogenous retroviruses and the clinical evidence of long-lasting porcine cell microchimerism indicate the potential for xenogeneic infections. Thus, further trials should continue under regulatory oversight, with close clinical and laboratory monitoring for potential xenogeneic infections.",

    "title": "Emerging Human Infectious Diseases: Anthroponoses, Zoonoses, and Sapronoses",
    "abstract_text": "To the Editor: The source of infection has always been regarded as an utmost factor in epidemiology. Human communicable diseases can be classified according to the source of infection as anthroponoses (when the source is an infectious human; interhuman transfer is typical), zoonoses (the source is an infectious animal; interhuman transfer is uncommon), and sapronoses (the source is an abiotic substrate, nonliving environment; interhuman transfer is exceptional). The source of infection is often the reservoir or, in ecologic terms, the habitat where the etiologic agent of the disease normally thrives, grows, and replicates. A characteristic feature of most zoonoses and sapronoses is that once transmitted to humans, the epidemic chain is usually aborted, but the clinical course might be sometimes quite severe, even fatal. An ecologic rule specifies that an obligatory parasite should not kill its host to benefit from the adapted long-term symbiosis, whereas an occasionally attacked alien host, such as a human, might be subjected to a severe disease or even killed rapidly by the parasite because no evolutionary adaptation to that host exists (1). In this letter, only microbial infections are discussed; metazoan invasion and infestations have been omitted.\r\n\r\nAnthroponoses (Greek \u201canthropos\u201d = man, \u201cnosos\u201d = disease) are diseases transmissible from human to human. Examples include rubella, smallpox, diphtheria, gonorrhea, ringworm (Trichophyton rubrum), and trichomoniasis.\r\n\r\nZoonoses (Greek \u201czoon\u201d = animal) are diseases transmissible from living animals to humans (2). These diseases were formerly called anthropozoonoses, and the diseases transmissible from humans to animals were called zooanthroponoses. Unfortunately, many scientists used these terms in the reverse sense or indiscriminately, and an expert committee decided to abandon these two terms and recommended \u201czoonoses\u201d as \u201cdiseases and infections which are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man\u201d (3). A limited number of zoonotic agents can cause extensive outbreaks; many zoonoses, however, attract the public\u2019s attention because of the high death rate associated with the infections. In addition, zoonoses are sometimes contagious for hospital personnel (e.g., hemorrhagic fevers). Zoonotic diseases can be classified according to the ecosystem in which they circulate. The classification is either synanthropic zoonoses, with an urban (domestic) cycle in which the source of infection are domestic and synanthropic animals (e.g., urban rabies, cat scratch disease, and zoonotic ringworm) or exoanthropic zoonoses, with a sylvatic (feral and wild) cycle in natural foci (4) outside human habitats (e.g., arboviroses, wildlife rabies, Lyme disease, and tularemia). However, some zoonoses can circulate in both urban and natural cycles (e.g., yellow fever and Chagas disease). A number of zoonotic agents are arthropod-borne (5); others are transmitted by direct contact, alimentary (foodborne and waterborne), or aerogenic (airborne) routes; and some are rodent-borne.\r\n\r\nSapronoses (Greek \u201csapros\u201d = decaying; \u201csapron\u201d means in ecology a decaying organic substrate) are human diseases transmissible from abiotic environment (soil, water, decaying plants, or animal corpses, excreta, and other substrata). The ability of the agent to grow saprophytically and replicate in these substrata (i.e., not only to survive or contaminate them secondarily) are the most important characteristics of a sapronotic microbe. Sapronotic agents thus carry on two diverse ways of life: saprophytic (in an abiotic substrate at ambient temperature) and parasitic (pathogenic, at the temperature of a homeotherm vertebrate host). Typical sapronoses are visceral mycoses caused by dimorphic fungi (e.g., coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis), \u201cmonomorphic\u201d fungi (e.g., aspergillosis and cryptococcosis), certain superficial mycoses (Microsporum gypseum), some bacterial diseases (e.g., legionellosis), and protozoan (e.g., primary amebic meningoencephalitis). Intracellular parasites of animals (viruses, rickettsiae, and chlamydiae) cannot be sapronotic agents. The term \u201csapronosis\u201d was introduced in epidemiology as a useful concept (6\u20138). For these diseases the expert committee applied the term \u201csapro-zoonoses,\u201d defined as \u201chaving both a vertebrate host and a nonanimal developmental site or reservoir (organic matter, soil, and plants)\u201d (3,9). However, the term sapronoses is more appropriate because animals are not the source of infection for humans. While anthroponoses and zoonoses are usually the domains for professional activities of human and veterinary microbiologists, respectively, sapronoses may be the domain for environmental microbiologists. The underdiagnosis rate for sapronoses is probably higher than that for anthroponoses and zoonoses, and an increase should be expected in both incidence and number of sapronoses. Legionellosis, Pontiac fever, nontuberculous mycobacterioses, and primary amebic meningoencephalitis are a few sapronoses that have emerged in the past decade. In addition, the number of opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed patients has grown markedly; many of these diseases and some nosocomial infections are, in fact, also sapronoses.\r\n\r\nAs with any classification, grouping human diseases in epidemiologic categories according to the source of infection has certain pitfalls. Some arthropod-borne diseases (urban yellow fever, dengue, epidemic typhus, tickborne relapsing fever, epidemic relapsing fever, and malaria) might be regarded as anthroponoses rather than zoonoses because the donor of the infectious blood for the vector is an infected human and not a vertebrate animal. However, the human infection is caused by an (invertebrate) animal in which the agent replicates, and the term zoonoses is preferred. HIV is of simian origin with a sylvatic cycling among wild primates and accidental infection of humans who hunted or ate them; the human disease (AIDS) might thus have been regarded as a zoonosis in the very first phase but later has spread in the human population as a typical anthroponosis and caused the present pandemic. Similarly, pandemic strains of influenza developed through an antigenic shift from avian influenza A viruses. For some etiologic agents or their genotypes, both animals and humans are concurrent reservoirs (hepatitis virus E, Norwalk-like calicivirus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Pneumocystis, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Cyclospora); these diseases might conditionally be called anthropozoonoses. Other difficulties can occur with classifying diseases caused by sporulating bacteria (Clostridium and Bacillus): Their infective spores survive in the soil or in other substrata for very long periods, though they are usually produced after a vegetative growth in the abiotic environment, which can include animal carcasses. These diseases should therefore be called sapronoses. For some other etiologic agents, both animals and abiotic environment can be the reservoir (Listeria, Erysipelothrix, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, and Rhodococcus equi), and the diseases might be, in fact, called saprozoonosis (not sensu 9 ) in that their source can be either an animal or an abiotic substrate.\r\n\r\nFor a concise list of anthropo-, zoo-, and sapronoses, see the Appendix.",

These systems have a growing evidence base showing a high degree of accuracy and increased sensitivity and timeliness relative to traditional healthcare-based systems. They have also proven useful for assessing risk factors, vaccine effectiveness, and patterns of healthcare utilization while being less expensive, more flexible, and more scalable than traditional systems. Nonetheless, they present important challenges including biases associated with the population that chooses to participate, difficulty in adjusting for confounders, and limited specificity because of reliance only on syndromic definitions of disease limits.

    "abstract_text": "Passive immunization by oral administration of specific antibodies has been an attractive approach against gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens in both humans and animals. Recently, laying chickens have attracted considerable attention as an alternative source of antibodies for the prevention and treatment of infectious GI diseases. After immunization, the specific antibodies (called IgY) are transported to the egg yolk, from which the IgY then can be separated without sacrificing chickens. A chicken usually lays about 280 eggs in a year, and egg yolk contains 100-150 mg of IgY per yolk, suggesting that more than 40 g of IgY per year can be obtained from each chicken through eggs. IgY is also an alternative to antibiotics for treatment of enteric antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Oral administration of IgY has proved successful for treatment of a variety of GI infections, such as bovine and human rotaviruses, bovine coronavirus, Yersinia ruckeri, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Edwardsiella tarda, Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas. The IgY technology offers great future opportunities for designing prophylactic strategies against infectious GI diseases in humans and animals. However, there is still controversy regarding the stability of IgY through the GI tract. Finding an effective way to protect the antibodies from degradation in the GI tract would open the door for significant advances in IgY technology and nutraceutical applications.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary Bats are hosts to a range of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic pathogens. Human activities that increase exposure to bats will likely increase the opportunity for infections to spill over in the future. Ecological drivers of pathogen spillover and emergence in novel hosts, including humans, involve a complex mixture of processes, and understanding these complexities may aid in predicting spillover. In particular, only once the pathogen and host ecologies are known can the impacts of anthropogenic changes be fully appreciated. Cross\u2010disciplinary approaches are required to understand how host and pathogen ecology interact. Bats differ from other sylvatic disease reservoirs because of their unique and diverse lifestyles, including their ability to fly, often highly gregarious social structures, long lifespans and low fecundity rates. We highlight how these traits may affect infection dynamics and how both host and pathogen traits may interact to affect infection dynamics. We identify key questions relating to the ecology of infectious diseases in bats and propose that a combination of field and laboratory studies are needed to create data\u2010driven mechanistic models to elucidate those aspects of bat ecology that are most critical to the dynamics of emerging bat viruses. If commonalities can be found, then predicting the dynamics of newly emerging diseases may be possible. This modelling approach will be particularly important in scenarios when population surveillance data are unavailable and when it is unclear which aspects of host ecology are driving infection dynamics.",

Biological impoverishment, habitat fragmentation, climate change, increasing toxification, and the rapid global movement of people and other living organisms have worked synergistically to diminish ecosystem function. This has resulted in unprecedented levels of disease emergence driven by human\u2010induced environmental degradation, which poses a threat to the survival and health of biodiversity. What is often overlooked in the discussion of the health consequences to humans is that critically endangered wildlife species are at grave risk of extinction by disease outbreaks. As habitat becomes more compressed and with migration routes cut off, gene pools of small species are stranded in isolated habitat fragments. Species now are vulnerable to encroachment, malnutrition, environmental pollutants, and epidemics from domestic animals and humans. Furthermore, the continuous degradation of ecosystems is leading to increased stress, immunosuppression, and greater susceptibility to disease. Disease can be catastrophic to a diminished stressed population, becoming in some instances the leading factor of local, regional, and global extinctions. The strategies of the new field of conservation medicine include long\u2010term monitoring, health assessment, and interventions to protect species at risk. We particularly must minimize the threat of any potentially catastrophic disease outbreaks resulting from anthropogenic changes to the environment.

    "abstract_text": "During the 2001 foot and mouth disease epidemic in the UK, initial dissemination of the disease to widespread geographical regions was attributed to livestock movement, especially of sheep. In response, recording schemes to provide accurate data describing the movement of large livestock in Great Britain (GB) were introduced. Using these data, we reconstruct directed contact networks within the sheep industry and identify key epidemiological properties of these networks. There is clear seasonality in sheep movements, with a peak of intense activity in August and September and an associated high risk of a large epidemic. The high correlation between the in and out degree of nodes favours disease transmission. However, the contact networks were largely dissasortative: highly connected nodes mostly connect to nodes with few contacts, effectively slowing the spread of disease. This is a result of bipartite-like network properties, with most links occurring between highly active markets and less active farms. When comparing sheep movement networks (SMNs) to randomly generated networks with the same number of nodes and node degrees, despite structural differences (such as disassortativity and higher frequency of even path lengths in the SMNs), the characteristic path lengths within the SMNs are close to values computed from the corresponding random networks, showing that SMNs have \u2018small-world\u2019-like properties. Using the network properties, we show that targeted biosecurity or surveillance at highly connected nodes would be highly effective in preventing a large and widespread epidemic.",

As pretransplant risk factors in KT donors and recipients presently do not translate into clinically validated measures regarding organ allocation, antiviral prophylaxis, or screening, all KT recipients should be screened for BKP yV\u2010 DNA emia monthly until month 9, and then every 3 months until 2 years posttransplant. Extended screening after 2 years may be considered in pediatric KT . Stepwise immunosuppression reduction is recommended for KT patients with plasma BKP yV\u2010 DNA emia of &gt;1000 copies/ mL sustained for 3 weeks or increasing to &gt;10 000 copies/ mL reflecting probable and presumptive BKP yV\u2010associated nephropathy, respectively. Reducing immunosuppression is also the primary intervention for biopsy\u2010proven BKP yV\u2010associated nephropathy. Hence, allograft biopsy is not required for treating BKP yV\u2010 DNA emic patients with baseline renal function. Despite virological rationales, proper randomized clinical trials are lacking to generally recommend treatment by switching from tacrolimus to cyclosporine\u2010A, from mycophenolate to mTOR inhibitors or leflunomide or by the adjunct use of intravenous immunoglobulins, leflunomide, or cidofovir. Fluoroquinolones are not recommended for prophylaxis or therapy. Retransplantation after allograft loss due to BKP yV nephropathy can be successful if BKP yV\u2010 DNA emia is definitively cleared, independent of failed allograft nephrectomy.",

    "title": "Social Contact Patterns in Vietnam and Implications for the Control of Infectious Diseases",
    "abstract_text": "Background The spread of infectious diseases from person to person is determined by the frequency and nature of contacts between infected and susceptible members of the population. Although there is a long history of using mathematical models to understand these transmission dynamics, there are still remarkably little empirical data on contact behaviors with which to parameterize these models. Even starker is the almost complete absence of data from developing countries. We sought to address this knowledge gap by conducting a household based social contact diary in rural Vietnam. Methods and Findings A diary based survey of social contact patterns was conducted in a household-structured community cohort in North Vietnam in 2007. We used generalized estimating equations to model the number of contacts while taking into account the household sampling design, and used weighting to balance the household size and age distribution towards the Vietnamese population. We recorded 6675 contacts from 865 participants in 264 different households and found that mixing patterns were assortative by age but were more homogenous than observed in a recent European study. We also observed that physical contacts were more concentrated in the home setting in Vietnam than in Europe but the overall level of physical contact was lower. A model of individual versus household vaccination strategies revealed no difference between strategies in the impact on R0. Conclusions and Significance This work is the first to estimate contact patterns relevant to the spread of infections transmitted from person to person by non-sexual routes in a developing country setting. The results show interesting similarities and differences from European data and demonstrate the importance of context specific data.",

    "abstract_text": "The 3rd edition of this book builds on the strengths of the previous edition and is undoubtedly the most comprehensive source of information on infectious diseases of the dog and cat. Published 7 years after the previous version, the 3rd edition has incorporated a variety of pathogens that have emerged or been recognized as of concern in dogs and cats during this period.\r\n\r\nThe book is divided into sections on viral, rickettsial, chlamydial, and mycoplasmal diseases; bacterial diseases; fungal diseases; and protozoal diseases. There is also a large section on clinical problems that addresses individual body systems, plus other areas such as fever, prevention and management of infectious diseases in different environments (i.e., multiple cat environments, kennels), zoonoses, and immunoprophylaxis. There are over 200 pages of appendices, covering topics such as vaccination recommendations, laboratory testing, diagnostic test kits, and formularies.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying CD contains full citations for all of the references, but no additional material, and is not likely to be frequently used by most individuals.\r\n\r\nOne of the strengths of this book is its comprehensive nature. Almost all pathogens are covered under headings of etiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical findings, diagnosis, pathologic findings, therapy, and public health considerations. Important issues regarding sample collection, diagnostic test selection, and test interpretation are introduced at the beginning of the major sections. There are numerous color images and tables that complement the text; an improvement from the previous version. Practical clinical information, including drug and dosage recommendations, is readily available, often in clear tables.\r\n\r\nAs with most books, there are some factual errors that mostly involve recent information and likely relate to the inherent lag time from writing to publication. These are, in general, minor and of little concern. One area, that may not receive adequate attention relative to other topics, is the prudent use of antimicrobials. This is an important topic in veterinary medicine but does not receive specific coverage. While certain section authors mention the issue briefly, there is a lack of a comprehensive overview of the subject. This concern is highlighted in Appendix 9, where various important human antimicrobials and recommended uses are included, but there is little to no discussion of prudent use.\r\n\r\nOverall, this book is a very comprehensive guide to infectious diseases of the dog and cat, and is a useful resource to the general practitioner and specialist alike.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract Immunopolymorphism is considered as an important aspect behind the resistance or susceptibility of the host to an infectious disease. Over the years, researchers have explored many genetic factors for their role in immune surveillance against infectious diseases. Polymorphic characters in the gene encoding Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) play profound roles in inducing differential immune responses by the host against parasitic infections. Protein(s) encoded by TLR gene(s) are immensely important due to their ability of recognizing different types of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). This study reviews the polymorphic residues present in the nucleotide or in the amino acid sequence of TLRs and their influence on alteration of inflammatory signalling pathways promoting either susceptibility or resistance to major infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, malaria and filariasis. Population\u2010based studies exploring TLR polymorphisms in humans are primarily emphasized to discuss the association of the polymorphic residues with the occurrence and epidemiology of the mentioned infectious diseases. Principal polymorphic residues in TLRs influencing immunity to infection are mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). I602S (TLR1), R677W (TLR2), P554S (TLR3), D299G (TLR4), F616L (TLR5), S249P (TLR6), Q11L (TLR7), M1V (TLR8), G1174A (TLR9) and G1031T (TLR10) are presented as the major influential SNPs in shaping immunity to pathogenic infections. The contribution of these SNPs in the structure\u2010function relationship of TLRs is yet not clear. Therefore, molecular studies on such polymorphisms can improve our understanding on the genetic basis of the immune response and pave the way for therapeutic intervention in a more feasible way.",

    "abstract_text": "There are many challenges to quantifying and evaluating the media impact on the control of emerging infectious diseases. We modeled such media impacts using a piecewise smooth function depending on both the case number and its rate of change. The proposed model was then converted into a switching system, with the switching surface determined by a functional relationship between susceptible populations and different subgroups of infectives. By parameterizing the proposed model with the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza outbreak data in the Shaanxi province of China, we observed that media impact switched off almost as the epidemic peaked. Our analysis implies that media coverage significantly delayed the epidemic's peak and decreased the severity of the outbreak. Moreover, media impacts are not always effective in lowering the disease transmission during the entire outbreak, but switch on and off in a highly nonlinear fashion with the greatest effect during the early stage of the outbreak. The finding draws the attention to the important role of informing the public about 'the rate of change of case numbers' rather than 'the absolute number of cases' to alter behavioral changes, through a self-adaptive media impact switching on and off, for better control of disease transmission.",

Given that meningitis can be fatal and many meningitis cases occurred in high-poverty areas, a simple, low-cost, highly sensitive method is in great need for immediate and early diagnosis of meningitis. Herein, we report a versatile and cost-effective polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/paper hybrid microfluidic device integrated with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the rapid, sensitive, and instrument-free detection of the main meningitis-causing bacteria, Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis). The introduction of paper into the microfluidic device for LAMP reactions enables stable test results over a much longer period of time than a paper-free microfluidic system. This hybrid system also offers versatile functions, by providing not only on-site qualitative diagnostic analysis (i.e., a yes or no answer), but also confirmatory testing and quantitative analysis in laboratory settings. The limit of detection of N. meningitidis is about 3 copies per LAMP zone within 45 min, close to single-bacterium detection sensitivity. In addition, we have achieved simple pathogenic microorganism detection without a laborious sample preparation process and without the use of centrifuges. This low-cost hybrid microfluidic system provides a simple and highly sensitive approach for fast instrument-free diagnosis of N. meningitidis in resource-limited settings. This versatile PDMS/paper microfluidic platform has great potential for the point of care (POC) diagnosis of a wide range of infectious diseases, especially for developing nations.",

The introduction of extensive transportation data sets is therefore an important step in order to develop epidemic models endowed with realism. We develop a general stochastic meta-population model that incorporates actual travel and census data among 3 100 urban areas in 220 countries. The model allows probabilistic predictions on the likelihood of country outbreaks and their magnitude. The level of predictability offered by the model can be quantitatively analyzed and related to the appearance of robust epidemic pathways that represent the most probable routes for the spread of the disease. In order to assess the predictive power of the model, the case study of the global spread of SARS is considered. The disease parameter values and initial conditions used in the model are evaluated from empirical data for Hong Kong. The outbreak likelihood for specific countries is evaluated along with the emerging epidemic pathways. Simulation results are in agreement with the empirical data of the SARS worldwide epidemic. The presented computational approach shows that the integration of long-range mobility and demographic data provides epidemic models with a predictive power that can be consistently tested and theoretically motivated. This computational strategy can be therefore considered as a general tool in the analysis and forecast of the global spreading of emerging diseases and in the definition of containment policies aimed at reducing the effects of potentially catastrophic outbreaks.",

The difficulties most likely to be encountered at each step are described and possible solutions are offered. Examples of successful and unsuccessful modelling are presented and discussed. Other methods, such as INAR modelling or Markov chain analysis, which can be applied to situations where ARIMA modelling fails are also dealt with, but they are less practical. ARIMA modelling can be carried out by adequately trained nonspecialists working for local agencies. Its usefulness resides mostly in providing an estimate of the variability to be expected among future observations. This knowledge is helpful in deciding whether or not an unusual situation, possibly an outbreak, is developing.",

Much about the epidemiology of a disease can be learned when these individual transmission events are known or can be estimated. Such estimations are difficult and generally feasible only when detailed epidemiological data are available. The genealogy estimated from genetic sequences of sampled pathogens is another rich source of information on transmission history. Optimal inference of transmission events calls for the combination of genetic data and epidemiological data into one joint analysis. A key difficulty is that the transmission tree, which describes the transmission events between infected hosts, differs from the phylogenetic tree, which describes the ancestral relationships between pathogens sampled from these hosts. The trees differ both in timing of the internal nodes and in topology. These differences become more pronounced when a higher fraction of infected hosts is sampled. We show how the phylogenetic tree of sampled pathogens is related to the transmission tree of an outbreak of an infectious disease, by the within-host dynamics of pathogens. We provide a statistical framework to infer key epidemiological and mutational parameters by simultaneously estimating the phylogenetic tree and the transmission tree. We test the approach using simulations and illustrate its use on an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The approach unifies existing methods in the emerging field of phylodynamics with transmission tree reconstruction methods that are used in infectious disease epidemiology.",

A new concept has been proposed that PDT\u2010induced acute inflammation can mediate neutrophil infiltration to deliver therapeutics in deep tumor tissues. Combination of PDT and immunotherapies (neutrophil\u2010mediated therapeutic delivery) has shown the promising translation of PDT for cancer therapies. Furthermore, a new area in PDT is to treat bacterial infections to overcome the antimicrobial resistance. Finally, we have discussed the new directions of PDT for therapies of cancer and infectious diseases.

In this statement, the American Thoracic Society (ATS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) propose recommendations to improve the control and prevention of TB in the United States and to progress toward its elimination. This statement is one in a series issued periodically by the sponsoring organizations to guide the diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention of TB. This statement supersedes the previous statement by ATS and CDC, which was also supported by IDSA and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). This statement was drafted, after an evidence-based review of the subject, by a panel of representatives of the three sponsoring organizations. AAP, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association, and the Canadian Thoracic Society were also represented on the panel. This statement integrates recent scientific advances with current epidemiologic data, other recent guidelines from this series, and other sources into a coherent and practical approach to the control of TB in the United States. Although drafted to apply to TB-control activities in the United States, this statement might be of use in other countries in which persons with TB generally have access to medical and public health services and resources necessary to make a precise diagnosis of the disease; achieve curative medical treatment; and otherwise provide substantial science-based protection of the population against TB. This statement is aimed at all persons who advocate, plan, and work at controlling and preventing TB in the United States, including persons who formulate public health policy and make decisions about allocation of resources for disease control and health maintenance and directors and staff members of state, county, and local public health agencies throughout the United States charged with control of TB. The audience also includes the full range of medical practitioners, organizations, and institutions involved in the health care of persons in the United States who are at risk for TB.",

More attention is being paid to its particularly high expression in tissue pathology sites during disease such the tumor microenvironment. The MR recognizes a variety of microorganisms by their mannan-coated cell wall, which is exploited by adapted intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, for their own survival. Despite the continued development of drug delivery technologies, the targeting of agents to immune cells, especially macrophages, for effective diagnosis and treatment of chronic infectious diseases has not been addressed adequately. In this regard, strategies that optimize MR-mediated uptake by macrophages in target tissues during infection are becoming an attractive approach. We review important progress in this area.",

However, whether combining these markers improves prognostic accuracy and whether they predict prognosis for injection drug users (IDUs) and nonwhite persons infected with HIV has not been extensively investigated.Objective.\u2014To evaluate plasma viral load and CD4+ cell count as prognostic indicators for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and infectious disease deaths.Design.\u2014Cohort study initiated in 1988 and 1989 with follow-up for up to 7.9 years.Participants.\u2014Injection drug users infected with HIV recruited from the community in Baltimore, Md.Main Outcome Measures.\u2014Plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ cell count measured at baseline compared with time to first clinical AIDS diagnosis and death due to an infectious disease.Results.\u2014Of 522 subjects, 96% were African American, 80% were male, 96% injected drugs within the past 6 months, and the median age was 33 years. A total of 146 cases of AIDS and 119 infectious disease deaths were seen during a median follow-up period of 6.4 years. Time-fixed baseline levels of viral load and CD4+ cell count were independent predictors of progression to AIDS and infectious disease deaths, but in proportional hazards models, viral load had better predictive value than CD4+ cell count. Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to AIDS and to infectious disease deaths by viral load (<500, 500-9999, 10000-29999, \u226530000 copies/mL) at 3 levels of CD4+ cell count (<0.20, 0.20-0.49, and \u22650.50\u00d7109/L [<200, 200-499, and \u2265500/\u00b5L]) was reduced to a 5-stage classification scheme using a backward stepwise regression procedure. The 5-year cumulative probabilities for AIDS and infectious disease deaths ranged from 0% and 0%, respectively, for group I (viral load, <500 copies/mL; CD4+ cell count, 0.50\u00d7109/L) to 81.2% and 76.1% respectively, for group V (viral load, \u226510000 copies/mL; CD4+ cell count, 0.20\u00d7109/L).Conclusions.\u2014In this study, plasma HIV-1 viral load independently and in combination with CD4+ cell count measurements provided powerful prognostic information for progression to AIDS and death caused by infectious disease in a population of predominantly African American IDUs. Combining categories of both markers provided a simple method for prognostically staging HIV disease.",

The pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been classified as a zoonotic disease, however, no animal reservoir has yet been found, so this classification is premature. We propose that COVID-19 should instead be classified an \u201c emerging infectious disease (EID) of probable animal origin .\u201d To explore if COVID-19 infection fits our proposed re-categorization vs. the contemporary definitions of zoonoses, we reviewed current evidence of infection origin and transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 virus and described this in the context of known zoonoses, EIDs and \u201cspill-over\u201d events. Although the initial one hundred COVID-19 patients were presumably exposed to the virus at a seafood Market in China, and despite the fact that 33 of 585 swab samples collected from surfaces and cages in the market tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, no virus was isolated directly from animals and no animal reservoir was detected. Elsewhere, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in animals including domesticated cats, dogs, and ferrets, as well as captive-managed mink, lions, tigers, deer, and mice confirming zooanthroponosis. Other than circumstantial evidence of zoonotic cases in mink farms in the Netherlands, no cases of natural transmission from wild or domesticated animals have been confirmed. More than 40 million human COVID-19 infections reported appear to be exclusively through human-human transmission. SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 do not meet the WHO definition of zoonoses. We suggest SARS-CoV-2 should be re-classified as an EID of probable animal origin.",

We studied whether larger social groups are more subdivided structurally. If so, the social subdivisions that form in larger groups may act as barriers to the spread of infection, weakening the association between group size and infectious disease. To investigate this 'social bottleneck' hypothesis, we examined the association between group size and four network structure metrics in 43 vertebrate and invertebrate species. We focused on metrics involving modularity, clustering, distance and centralization. In a meta-analysis of intraspecific variation in social networks, modularity showed positive associations with network size, with a weaker but still positive effect in cross-species analyses. Network distance also showed a positive association with group size when using intraspecific variation. We then used a theoretical model to explore the effects of subgrouping relative to other effects that influence disease spread in socially structured populations. Outbreaks reached higher prevalence when groups were larger, but subgrouping reduced prevalence. Subgrouping also acted as a 'brake' on disease spread between groups. We suggest research directions to understand the conditions under which larger groups become more subdivided, and to devise new metrics that account for subgrouping when investigating the links between sociality and infectious disease risk.",

This variability critically determines the impact a disease has on a patient's life but is very poorly understood.

We identify a noncoding polymorphism in FOXO3A (rs12212067: T > G) at which the minor (G) allele, despite not being associated with disease susceptibility, is associated with a milder course of Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis and with increased risk of severe malaria. Minor allele carriage is shown to limit inflammatory responses in monocytes via a FOXO3-driven pathway, which through TGF\u03b21 reduces production of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF\u03b1, and increases production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10. Thus, we uncover a shared genetic contribution to prognosis in distinct diseases that operates via a FOXO3-driven pathway modulating inflammatory responses.PaperClip/cms/asset/8296ce7c-a7e1-4634-a4b8-100784190d76/mmc5.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 3.45 MB) Download audio",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract A bidirectional communication exists between the CNS and the immune system. The autonomic nervous system, through neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, works in parallel with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis through the actions of glucocorticoids to modulate inflammatory events. The immune system, through the action of cytokines and other factors, in turn, activates the CNS to orchestrate negative-feedback mechanisms that keep the immune response in check. Disruption of these interactions has been associated with a number of syndromes including inflammatory, autoimmune, and cardiovascular diseases, metabolic and psychiatric disorders, and the development of shock. The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis also plays an important part in regulating immunity through the secretion of sex hormones. Although numerous studies have established a role for immunomodulation by estrogen and testosterone, the role of progesterone is less well understood. Progesterone is crucial for reproductive organ development and maintenance of pregnancy, and more recent studies have clearly shown its role as an important immune regulator. The main focus of this review will be about the role of steroid hormones, specifically glucocorticoids and progesterone, in inflammatory responses and infectious diseases and how dysregulation of their actions may contribute to development of autoimmune and inflammatory disease.",

Straightforward simulations of such process do not scale well, limiting the use of individual-based models to very small populations. EpiSimdemics is specifically designed to scale to social networks with 100 million individuals. The scaling is obtained by exploiting the semantics of disease evolution and disease propagation in large networks. We evaluate an MPI-based parallel implementation of EpiSimdemics on a mid-sized HPC system, demonstrating that EpiSimdemics scales well.

The authors use probabilistic models to determine the conditions under which quarantine is expected to be useful. Results demonstrate that the number of infections averted (per initially infected individual) through the use of quarantine is expected to be very low provided that isolation is effective, but it increases abruptly and at an accelerating rate as the effectiveness of isolation diminishes. When isolation is ineffective, the use of quarantine will be most beneficial when there is significant asymptomatic transmission and if the asymptomatic period is neither very long nor very short.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract Background Both religious practices and male circumcision (MC) have been associated with HIV and other sexually-transmitted infectious diseases. Most studies have been limited in size and have not adequately controlled for religion, so these relationships remain unclear. Methods We evaluated relationships between MC prevalence, Muslim and Christian religion, and 7 infectious diseases using country-specific data among 118 developing countries. We used multivariate linear regression to describe associations between MC and cervical cancer incidence, and between MC and HIV prevalence among countries with primarily sexual HIV transmission. Results Fifty-three, 14, and 51 developing countries had a high (&gt;80%), intermediate (20\u201380%), and low (&lt;20%) MC prevalence, respectively. In univariate analyses, MC was associated with lower HIV prevalence and lower cervical cancer incidence, but not with HSV-2, syphilis, nor, as expected, with Hepatitis C, tuberculosis, or malaria. In multivariate analysis after stratifying the countries by religious groups, each categorical increase of MC prevalence was associated with a 3.65/100,000 women (95% CI 0.54-6.76, p = 0.02) decrease in annual cervical cancer incidence, and a 1.84-fold (95% CI 1.36-2.48, p &lt; 0.001) decrease in the adult HIV prevalence among sub-Saharan African countries. In separate multivariate analyses among non-sub-Saharan African countries controlling for religion, higher MC prevalence was associated with a 8.94-fold (95% CI 4.30-18.60) decrease in the adult HIV prevalence among countries with primarily heterosexual HIV transmission, but not, as expected, among countries with primarily homosexual or injection drug use HIV transmission (p = 0.35). Conclusion Male circumcision was significantly associated with lower cervical cancer incidence and lower HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa, independent of Muslim and Christian religion. As predicted, male circumcision was also strongly associated with lower HIV prevalence among countries with primarily heterosexual HIV transmission, but not among countries with primarily homosexual or injection drug use HIV transmission. These findings strengthen the reported biological link between MC and some sexually transmitted infectious diseases, including HIV and cervical cancer.",

    "abstract_text": "Despite inherent difficulties in defining and measuring stress, a scientific framework has been provided in recent years for understanding how disruptive life experiences might be translated into altered susceptibility to infectious diseases. Studies of the effects of stress on pathogenesis of infectious disease are highly relevant to assessment of the biological importance of the immune impairments that have been associated with stress. With a few notable exceptions, investigations of viral infections in humans and in animal models support the hypothesis that stress promotes the pathogenesis of such infections. Similar conclusions can be drawn from studies of bacterial infections in humans and animals and from a small number of studies of parasitic infections in rodent models. While many of these studies have substantial limitations, the data nonetheless suggest that stress is a potential cofactor in the pathogenesis of infectious disease. Given recent unprecedented advances in the neurosciences, in immunology, and in the field of microbial pathogenesis, the relationship between stress and infection should be a fruitful topic for interdisciplinary research.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract Firstly, this review was performed to assess the effect of breastfeeding on infections during infancy in industrialized countries. Secondly, the effect of duration and exclusiveness of breastfeeding were explored. Studies were identified using Medline, Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index and by a manual search from bibliographies of articles from August 1986 to January 2008. Follow\u2010up, case\u2013control and randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies performed in an industrialized country, published in English, with breastfeeding as a determinant, with overall infections, gastrointestinal or respiratory tract infections as a major outcome, and at least 40 participants in the study were included. Using Bauchner's criteria published in a review in 1986, two reviewers and a peer reviewer assessed the internal validity of those studies. Twenty\u2010one studies that met the inclusion and internal validity criteria were included. These included 16 follow\u2010up and four case\u2013control studies and one RCT. Four out of five studies observed decreased effects on overall infections in breastfed infants. With regard to gastrointestinal infections, six out of eight studies suggested that breastfeeding had a protective effect. Thirteen out of 16 studies concluded that breastfeeding protects infants against respiratory tract infections. Five studies combined duration and exclusiveness of breastfeeding. All studies observed a protective dose/duration\u2010response effect on gastrointestinal or respiratory tract infections. These studies strongly suggest that breastfeeding protects infants against overall infections, gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections in industrialized countries. The optimal duration of exclusive breastfeeding for protection against infectious diseases needs to be studied in more detail.",

They form on natural surfaces such as heart valves or abiotic surfaces such as contact lenses or intraocular lenses. The biofilm matrix promotes adherence of the microbe to smooth surfaces as well as to other cells. Biofilms thereby form large 3-dimensional microbial communities of complex architecture through cell-to-cell communication and coordinated multicellular behavior. The biofilm architecture promotes the exchange of nutrients and waste products. The ability of microorganisms to attach to abiotic surfaces and grow in highly stable communities greatly confounds the medical use of implantable devices. Much effort is now being invested to understand the molecular nature of biofilms, with a view toward designing biofilm-resistant implantable devices and more effective antimicrobials.",

    "abstract_text": "Emerging infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, SARS, and pandemic influenza, and the anthrax attacks of 2001, have demonstrated that we remain vulnerable to health threats caused by infectious diseases. The importance of strengthening global public health surveillance to provide early warning has been the primary recommendation of expert groups for at least the past 2 decades. However, despite improvements in the past decade, public health surveillance capabilities remain limited and fragmented, with uneven global coverage. Recent initiatives provide hope of addressing this issue, and new technological and conceptual advances could, for the first time, place capability for global surveillance within reach. Such advances include the revised International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) and the use of new data sources and methods to improve global coverage, sensitivity, and timeliness, which show promise for providing capabilities to extend and complement the existing infrastructure. One example is syndromic surveillance, using nontraditional and often automated data sources. Over the past 20 years, other initiatives, including ProMED-mail, GPHIN, and HealthMap, have demonstrated new mechanisms for acquiring surveillance data. In 2009 the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) began the Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) program, which includes the PREDICT project, to build global capacity for surveillance of novel infections that have pandemic potential (originating in wildlife and at the animal-human interface) and to develop a framework for risk assessment. Improved understanding of factors driving infectious disease emergence and new technological capabilities in modeling, diagnostics and pathogen identification, and communications, such as using the increasing global coverage of cellphones for public health surveillance, can further enhance global surveillance.",

The findings demonstrate that social media use is positively related to both of these emotions, which are also positively related to the public's risk perception. The findings also indicate that social media use can significantly increase preventive behaviors via the two self-relevant emotions and the public's risk perception.",

TLRs are also triggered by danger signals released by injured or stressed cells during sepsis. Here we focus on studies developing TLR agonists and antagonists for the treatment of infectious diseases and sepsis. Positioned at the cell surface, TLR4 is essential for sensing lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria, TLR2 is involved in the recognition of a large panel of microbial ligands, while TLR5 recognizes flagellin. Endosomal TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9 are specialized in the sensing of nucleic acids produced notably during viral infections. TLR4 and TLR2 are favorite targets for developing anti-sepsis drugs, and antagonistic compounds have shown efficient protection from septic shock in preclinical models. Results from clinical trials evaluating anti-TLR4 and anti-TLR2 approaches are presented, discussing the challenges of study design in sepsis and future exploitation of these agents in infectious diseases. We also report results from studies suggesting that the TLR5 agonist flagellin may protect from infections of the gastrointestinal tract and that agonists of endosomal TLRs are very promising for treating chronic viral infections. Altogether, TLR-targeted therapies have a strong potential for prevention and intervention in infectious diseases, notably sepsis.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract Motivation Accumulating clinical observations have indicated that microbes living in the human body are closely associated with a wide range of human noninfectious diseases, which provides promising insights into the complex disease mechanism understanding. Predicting microbe\u2013disease associations could not only boost human disease diagnostic and prognostic, but also improve the new drug development. However, little efforts have been attempted to understand and predict human microbe\u2013disease associations on a large scale until now. Results In this work, we constructed a microbe-human disease association network and further developed a novel computational model of KATZ measure for Human Microbe\u2013Disease Association prediction (KATZHMDA) based on the assumption that functionally similar microbes tend to have similar interaction and non-interaction patterns with noninfectious diseases, and vice versa. To our knowledge, KATZHMDA is the first tool for microbe\u2013disease association prediction. The reliable prediction performance could be attributed to the use of KATZ measurement, and the introduction of Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for microbes and diseases. LOOCV and k-fold cross validation were implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of this novel computational model based on known microbe\u2013disease associations obtained from HMDAD database. As a result, KATZHMDA achieved reliable performance with average AUCs of 0.8130 \u00b1 0.0054, 0.8301 \u00b1 0.0033 and 0.8382 in 2-fold and 5-fold cross validation and LOOCV framework, respectively. It is anticipated that KATZHMDA could be used to obtain more novel microbes associated with important noninfectious human diseases and therefore benefit drug discovery and human medical improvement.

    "abstract_text": "Platelets are anucleate, circulating cells produced by megakaryocytes. Platelets are the second most abundant circulating cells in the vasculature. In recent years, a robust body of literature supports the evolving role of platelets as key sentinel and effector cells in infectious diseases. Among their diverse roles, platelets are especially critical in bridging hemostatic, inflammatory, and immune continuums. Upon intravascular pathogen invasion, platelets sense and respond to viral, parasitic, and bacterial infections. In some cases, platelets directly bind to pathogens through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and integrin receptors or pathogen: immunoglobulin complexes through Fc and complement receptors \u2013 although our understanding of these interactions remains incomplete. Constantly scanning for areas of injury or inflammation as they circulate in the vasculature, platelets also indirectly respond to pathogen invasion through interactions with leukocytes and the endothelium. Through a diverse repertoire of mechanisms, activated platelets can directly kill pathogens, recruit leukocytes, and promote neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation to facilitate pathogen clearance. At times, however, platelet activation may also be injurious to the host, exacerbating inflammation and promoting endothelial damage, coagulation, and thrombosis. There are many gaps in our understandings of the role of platelets in infectious diseases. However, with the emergence of advanced technologies, our knowledge is increasing. In the current review, we discuss these evolving roles of platelets in infectious diseases, highlighting the complex interplay of these processes with hemostatic and thrombotic pathways.",

Several well-established methodologies are available, including risk factor analysis, risk modelling and dynamic modelling. Even so, predictive modelling is very much the 'art of the possible', which tends to drive research effort towards some areas and away from others which may be at least as important. Building on the undoubted success of quantitative modelling of the epidemiology and control of human and animal diseases such as AIDS, influenza, foot-and-mouth disease and BSE, attention needs to be paid to developing a more holistic framework that captures the role of the underlying drivers of disease risks, from demography and behaviour to land use and climate change. At the same time, there is still considerable room for improvement in how quantitative analyses and their outputs are communicated to policy makers and other stakeholders. A starting point would be generally accepted guidelines for 'good practice' for the development and the use of predictive models.",

Food animal production has been transformed since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Poultry and swine production have changed from small-scale methods to industrial-scale operations. There is substantial evidence of pathogen movement between and among these industrial facilities, release to the external environment, and exposure to farm workers, which challenges the assumption that modern poultry production is more biosecure and biocontained as compared with backyard or small holder operations in preventing introduction and release of pathogens. An analysis of data from the Thai government investigation in 2004 indicates that the odds of H5N1 outbreaks and infections were significantly higher in large-scale commercial poultry operations as compared with backyard flocks. These data suggest that successful strategies to prevent or mitigate the emergence of pandemic avian influenza must consider risk factors specific to modern industrialized food animal production.",

    "title": "Bartonellosis: One Health Perspectives for an Emerging Infectious Disease",
    "abstract_text": "In recent years, an increasing number of Bartonella species have been identified as zoonotic pathogens, transmitted by animal bites, scratches, arthropods and even by needle sticks. Considering the diversity of newly discovered Bartonella species and subspecies and the large number and ecologically diverse animal reservoir hosts and the evolving spectrum of arthropod vectors that can transmit these bacteria among animals and humans, the clinical and diagnostic challenges posed by Bartonella transmission in nature are presumably much more complex than is currently appreciated by diagnosticians, vector biologists, ecologists, physicians, or veterinarians. Historically the term \"bartonellosis\" was attributed to infections with Bartonella bacilliformis, transmitted by sandflies in the Peruvian Andes. Currently, however, bartonellosis now includes infections caused by any Bartonella sp. anywhere in the world. Potentially, because Bartonella spp. can infect erythrocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, CD34(+) progenitor cells, and various macrophage-type cells, including microglial cells, dendritic cells, and circulating monocytes in vitro, the clinical and pathological manifestations of bartonellosis appear to be very diverse in both sick animals and human patients. Because 75% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, many of which are vector-transmitted by an arthropod, a One Health approach to bartonellosis and other zoonotic infections is needed to properly address animal health, public health, and environmental factors that influence the distribution and transmission of these bacteria. The One Health concept encourages a spirit of cooperation among animal, environmental, and human health professionals and promotes developing integrated solutions for complex problems that impact the health of animals, humans, and the planet. Importantly, substantial research is needed to define the medical importance of this genus as a cause of animal and human illnesses.",

    "abstract_text": "The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of tigecycline, a newly developed glycylcycline antibiotic, with those of empirical antibiotic regimens which have been reported to possess good efficacy for complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs), complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and other infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) identified in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase was performed. Eight RCTs involving 4,651 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with therapy with empirical antibiotic regimens, tigecycline monotherapy was associated with similar clinical treatment success rates (for the clinically evaluable [CE] population, odds ratio [OR] = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76 to 1.12, P = 0.42; for the clinical modified intent-to-treat [c-mITT] population, OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.74 to 1.01, P = 0.06) and similar microbiological treatment success rates (for the microbiologically evaluable [ME] population, OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.69 to 1.07, P = 0.19). The incidence of adverse events in the tigecycline group was significantly higher than that in the other therapy groups with a statistical margin (for the modified intent-to-treat [mITT] population, OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.17 to 1.52, P < 0.0001), especially in the digestive system (mITT population, OR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.67 to 3.46, P < 0.00001). No difference regarding all-cause mortality and drug-related mortality between tigecycline and the other regimens was found, although numerically higher mortality was found in the tigecycline group. This meta-analysis provides evidence that tigecycline monotherapy may be used as effectively as the comparison therapy for cSSSI, cIAIs, CAP, and infections caused by MRSA/VRE. However, because of the high risk of mortality, AEs, and emergence of resistant isolates, prudence with the clinical use of tigecycline monotherapy in infections is required.",

    "abstract_text": "Interferon-\u03bbs 1-4 (IFNL1-4) modulate immunity in the context of infections and autoimmune diseases, through a complex network of induced genes. IFN-\u03bbs act by binding to the hetero-dimeric IFN-\u03bb receptor (IFNLR), activating a STAT-phosphorylation dependent signalling cascade, and thereby inducing hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes modulating various immune functions via complex forward and feedback loops. In contrast to the IFN-\u03b1 signalling cascade, three important differences have been discovered. Firstly, the IFNLR is not ubiquitously expressed; in particular, immune cells show significant variation in the expression levels and susceptibilities to IFN-\u03bbs. Secondly, the binding affinities of individual IFN-\u03bbs to the IFNLR strongly varies and are generally lower compared to IFN-\u03b1 binding affinities. Finally, genetic variation in the form of a series of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to genes involved in the IFN-\u03bb signalling cascade has been described, and associated with the clinical course and treatment outcomes of hepatitis B and C virus infection. The clinical impact of the IFN-\u03bb signalling and the SNP variations may, however, reach far beyond viral hepatitis. Recent publications show important roles for IFN-\u03bbs in a broad range of viral infections such as human T-cell leukemia type-1 virus, rotaviruses and influenza virus. Potentially IFN-\u03bb even modulates the course of bacterial colonization and infections as shown for Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although the immunological processes involved in controlling viral and bacterial infections are highly diverse, IFN-\u03bbs may interfere at various levels: as an innate immune cytokine with direct antiviral effects; or as a modulator of the IFN-\u03b1 induced signalling via the suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1) and the Ubiquitin specific peptidase 18 (USP18) inhibitory feedback loops. In addition, the modulation of adaptive immune functions via macrophage and dendritic cell polarization, and subsequent priming, activation, and proliferation of pathogen-specific T- and B-cells may also be important elements associated with infectious diseases outcomes. This review summarizes the emerging details of the IFN-\u03bb immunobiology in the context of the host immune response and viral and bacterial infections.",

    "abstract_text": "Vector-borne emerging and re-emerging diseases pose considerable public health problem worldwide. Some of these diseases are emerging and/or re-emerging at increasing rates and appeared in new regions in the past two decades. Studies emphasized that the interactions among pathogens, hosts, and the environment play a key role for the emergence or re-emergence of these diseases. Furthermore, social and demographic factors such as human population growth, urbanization, globalization, trade exchange and travel and close interactions with livestock have significantly been linked with the emergence and/or re-emergence of vector-borne diseases. Other studies emphasize the ongoing evolution of pathogens, proliferation of reservoir populations, and antimicrobial drug use to be the principal exacerbating forces for emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne infectious diseases. Still other studies equivocally claim that climate change has been associated with appearance and resurgence of vector-borne infectious diseases. Despite the fact that many important emerging and re-emerging vector-borne infectious diseases are becoming better controlled, our success in stopping the many new appearing and resurging vector-borne infectious diseases that may happen in the future seems to be uncertain. Hence, this paper reviews and synthesizes the existing literature to explore global patterns of emerging and re-emerging vector-borne infections and the challenges for their control. It also attempts to give insights to the epidemiological profile of major vector-borne diseases including Zika fever, dengue, West Nile fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Chikungunya, Yellow fever, and Rift Valley fever.",

Quantification of neopterin in body fluids has been achieved by standard high-performance liquid chromatography, radioimmunoassays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Neopterin levels predict HIV-related mortality more efficiently than clinical manifestations. Successful highly active antiretroviral therapy is associated with a decrease in neopterin levels. Elevated neopterin levels were associated with hepatitis by hepatitis A, B, and C viruses. Serum neopterin levels were found to be a predictor of response to treatment of chronic HCV infection with pegylated interferon combined with ribavirin. Neopterin levels of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were found to be higher in patients with more extensive radiological changes. Elimination of blood donors with elevated neopterin levels to reduce risk of transmission of infections with known and unknown viral pathogens has been undertaken. Neopterin measurement is hereby more cost effective but less sensitive than screening using polymerase chain reaction based assays. In conclusion neopterin is a nonspecific marker of activated T-helper cell 1 dominated immune response. It may be a useful marker for monitoring of infectious disease activity during treatment and for more accurate estimation of extent of disease and prognosis.",

The diversity of parasitic organisms likely correlates with the hosts they live in and the number mammal hosts for zoonotic infections increases with species richness among mammalian orders. Thus, while habitat loss and fragmentation may reduce species diversity, the habitat encroachment by people into species-rich areas may increase the exposure of people to novel infectious agents from wildlife. Here, we present a theoretical framework that exploits the species\u2013area relationship to link the exposure of people to novel infections with habitat biodiversity. We model changes in human exposure to microbes through defined classes of habitat fragmentation and predict that increased habitat division intrinsically increases the hazard from microbes for all modelled biological systems. We apply our model to African tropical forests as an example. Our results suggest that it is possible to identify high-risk areas for the mitigation and surveillance of novel disease emergence and that mitigation measures may reduce this risk while conserving biodiversity.",

    "abstract_text": "To review the burden of allergic and infectious diseases and the evidence for a link to microbial exposure, the human microbiome and immune system, and to assess whether we could develop lifestyles which reconnect us with exposures which could reduce the risk of allergic disease while also protecting against infectious disease.Using methodology based on the Delphi technique, six experts in infectious and allergic disease were surveyed to allow for elicitation of group judgement and consensus view on issues pertinent to the aim.Key themes emerged where evidence shows that interaction with microbes that inhabit the natural environment and human microbiome plays an essential role in immune regulation. Changes in lifestyle and environmental exposure, rapid urbanisation, altered diet and antibiotic use have had profound effects on the human microbiome, leading to failure of immunotolerance and increased risk of allergic disease. Although evidence supports the concept of immune regulation driven by microbe-host interactions, the term 'hygiene hypothesis' is a misleading misnomer. There is no good evidence that hygiene, as the public understands, is responsible for the clinically relevant changes to microbial exposures.Evidence suggests a combination of strategies, including natural childbirth, breast feeding, increased social exposure through sport, other outdoor activities, less time spent indoors, diet and appropriate antibiotic use, may help restore the microbiome and perhaps reduce risks of allergic disease. Preventive efforts must focus on early life. The term 'hygiene hypothesis' must be abandoned. Promotion of a risk assessment approach (targeted hygiene) provides a framework for maximising protection against pathogen exposure while allowing spread of essential microbes between family members. To build on these findings, we must change public, public health and professional perceptions about the microbiome and about hygiene. We need to restore public understanding of hygiene as a means to prevent infectious disease.",

Control and treatment options using vaccines and drugs are either inadequate, inefficient, or impracticable. The classical approach in studying fish bacterial pathogens has been looking at individual or few virulence factors. Recently, genome sequencing of a number of bacterial fish pathogens has tremendously increased our understanding of the biology, host adaptation, and virulence factors of these important pathogens. This paper attempts to compile the scattered literature on genome sequence information of fish pathogenic bacteria published and available to date. The genome sequencing has uncovered several complex adaptive evolutionary strategies mediated by horizontal gene transfer, insertion sequence elements, mutations and prophage sequences operating in fish pathogens, and how their genomes evolved from generalist environmental strains to highly virulent obligatory pathogens. In addition, the comparative genomics has allowed the identification of unique pathogen-specific gene clusters. The paper focuses on the comparative analysis of the virulogenomes of important fish bacterial pathogens, and the genes involved in their evolutionary adaptation to different ecological niches. The paper also proposes some new directions on finding novel vaccine and chemotherapeutic targets in the genomes of bacterial pathogens of fish.",

Unfortunately, the gathering of high quality experimental data on contact patterns in human populations is a very difficult task even at the coarse level of mixing patterns among age groups. Here we propose an alternative route to the estimation of mixing patterns that relies on the construction of virtual populations parametrized with highly detailed census and demographic data. We present the modeling of the population of 26 European countries and the generation of the corresponding synthetic contact matrices among the population age groups. The method is validated by a detailed comparison with the matrices obtained in six European countries by the most extensive survey study on mixing patterns. The methodology presented here allows a large scale comparison of mixing patterns in Europe, highlighting general common features as well as country-specific differences. We find clear relations between epidemiologically relevant quantities (reproduction number and attack rate) and socio-demographic characteristics of the populations, such as the average age of the population and the duration of primary school cycle. This study provides a numerical approach for the generation of human mixing patterns that can be used to improve the accuracy of mathematical models in the absence of specific experimental data.",

We test the hypothesis that perceived threat of infectious disease exerts a unique influence on conformist attitudes and behavior. Correlational and experimental results support the hypothesis. Individual differences in Perceived Vulnerability to Disease predict conformist attitudes; these effects persist when controlling for individual differences in the Belief in a Dangerous World. Experimentally manipulated salience of disease threat produced stronger conformist attitudes and behavior, compared with control conditions (including a condition in which disease\u2010irrelevant threats were salient). Additional results suggest that these effects may be especially pronounced in specific domains of normative behavior that are especially pertinent to pathogen transmission. These results have implications for understanding the antecedents of conformity, the psychology of threat, and the social consequences of infectious disease.

To evaluate the relationship between specific sleep patterns and the clinical response to infectious disease, we classified sleep patterns in rabbits inoculated with E. coli, S. aureus, or C. albicans on the basis of the duration of the period of enhanced sleep. Patterns characterized by a long period of enhanced sleep were associated with a more favorable prognosis and less severe clinical signs than were patterns characterized by relatively short periods of enhanced sleep followed by prolonged sleep suppression. A contrasting analysis of these data indicated that animals that eventually died demonstrated reduced sleep compared to rabbits that survived the infection.

    "abstract_text": "Abstract: The mechanisms by which outbreeding depression leads to reduced fitness are poorly understood. We considered the hypothesis that outbreeding can depress fitness by increasing the susceptibility of hybrid individuals and populations to infectious disease. Competitive breeding trials in experimental ponds indicated that outbred largemouth bass ( Micropterus salmoides ) crossed from two geographically and genetically distinct populations suffered a reduction in fitness of approximately 14% relative to parental stocks. We measured the comparative susceptibility of these same outbred stocks to a novel viral pathogen, largemouth bass virus. Following experimental inoculation, F2 generation hybrids suffered mortality at a rate 3.6 times higher than either F1 generation hybrids or wild\u2010type parental fish. Analysis of viral loads indicated that viral replication was more rapid in F2 fish than in F1 hybrids or wild\u2010type parental fish. We attribute these results to the disruption of coadapted gene complexes in the immune systems of outbred fish in the F2 generation. Increased susceptibility to infectious disease may be an important but underappreciated mechanism by which outbreeding reduces the fitness of individuals and populations and by which novel infectious diseases emerge in populations of hybrid organisms.",

    "abstract_text": "Background. Previous studies, largely based on chart reviews with small sample sizes, have demonstrated that infectious diseases (ID) specialists positively impact patient outcomes. We investigated how ID specialists impact mortality, utilization, and costs using a large claims dataset. Methods. We used administrative fee-for-service Medicare claims to identify beneficiaries hospitalized from 2008 to 2009 with at least 1 of 11 infections. There were 101 991 stays with and 170 336 stays without ID interventions. Cohorts were propensity score matched for patient demographics, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics. Regression models compared ID versus non-ID intervention and early versus late ID intervention. Risk-adjusted outcomes included hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), mortality, readmissions, hospital charges, and Medicare payments. Results. The ID intervention cohort demonstrated significantly lower mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], .83 to .91) and readmissions (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, .93 to .99) than the non-ID intervention cohort. Medicare charges and payments were not significantly different; the ID intervention cohort ICU LOS was 3.7% shorter (95% CI, \u22125.5% to \u22121.9%). Patients receiving ID intervention within 2 days of admission had significantly lower 30-day mortality and readmission, hospital and ICU length of stay, and Medicare charges and payments compared with patients receiving later ID interventions. Conclusions. ID interventions are associated with improved patient outcomes. Early ID interventions are also associated with reduced costs for Medicare beneficiaries with select infections.",

    "abstract_text": "Bioethics emerged at a time when infectious diseases were not a major concern. Thus bioethics never had to develop a normative framework sensitive to situations of disease transmission. The Patient as Victim and Vector explores how traditional and new issues in clinical medicine, research, public health, and health policy might look different in infectious disease were treated as central. The authors argue that both practice and policy must recognize that a patient with a communicable infectious disease is not only a victim of that disease, but also a potential vector- someone who may transmit an illness that will sicken or kill others. Bioethics has failed to see one part of this duality, they document, and public health the other: that the patient is both victim and vector at one and the same time. The Patient as Victim and Vector is jointly written by four authors at the University of Utah with expertise in bioethics, health law, and both clinical practice and public health policy concerning infectious disease. Part I shows how the patient-centered ethic that was developed by bioethics- especially the concept of autonomy- needs to change in the context of public health, and Part II develops a normative theory for doing so. Part III examines traditional and new issues involving infectious disease: the ethics of quarantine and isolation, research, disease screening, rapid testing, antibiotic use, and immunization, in contexts like multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, syphilis, hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, and HPV. Part IV, beginning with a controversial thought experiment, considers constraint in the control of infectious disease, include pandemics, and Part V 'thinks big' about the global scope of infectious disease and efforts to prevent, treat, or eradicate it.

They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. IDSA considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances. These guidelines are intended for use by healthcare professionals who care for patients at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), including specialists in infectious diseases, pulmonary diseases, critical care, and surgeons, anesthesiologists, hospitalists, and any clinicians and healthcare providers caring for hospitalized patients with nosocomial pneumonia. The panel's recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of HAP and VAP are based upon evidence derived from topic-specific systematic literature reviews.",

Thorough recording of epidemiological and clinical aspects of imported malaria has been helpful in the detection of new outbreaks and areas of developing drug resistance. Sentinel surveillance of data collected prospectively since 1999 has begun within TropNetEurop, a European network focusing on imported infectious diseases. TropNetEurop appears to cover \u223c10% of all patients with malaria seen in Europe. Reports of 1659 immigrants and European patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria were analyzed for epidemiological information and data on clinical features. Regional data were quite diverse, reflecting local patterns of immigration and international travel. By far, the most infections were imported from West Africa. Europeans had more clinical complications; consequently, all deaths occurred in this group. Compared with European standards, the mortality rate was low (0.6% in Europeans). Data from TropNetEurop member sites can contribute to our understanding of the epidemiological and clinical findings regarding imported falciparum malaria.",

    "abstract_text": "Investigations on infectious diseases of Pacific salmon due to micro-organisms other than viruses are reviewed. The etiological agents include trematodes, fungi, protozoa and bacteria. Bacteria have been found to be the most important agents of disease in the several species of Pacific salmon. Kidney disease, due to a small, unnamed Gram-positive diplobacillus, causes serious mortalities in young salmon reared in hatcheries. The disease has also been found in wild fish. Aquatic myxobacteria are important agents of disease both in the hatchery and in the natural habitat. One of the myxobacteria, Chondrococcus columnaris, causes disease at relatively high water temperatures. The problem of the taxonomy of this organism is discussed. Another myxobacterium, Cytophaga psychrophila, has been found responsible for epizootics in coho salmon at lower water temperatures, i.e., in the range of 40\u00b0 to 55\u00b0 F. In outbreaks of gill disease in young salmon, myxobacteria of several kinds have been implicated. A variety of bacteria has been found responsible for outbreaks of disease in salmon in sea water. The most important of these is a species of Vibrio. Tuberculosis has been found in adult chinook salmon and the evidence indicates that the disease was contracted at sea.",

Recent findings Numerous molecular assays have been developed recently using a variety of technologies. Direct hybridization techniques have allowed analysis of blood culture bottles for organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Target amplification methods allow postamplification analysis using a variety of technologies depending on the clinical needs for the assay. Postamplification analysis includes methods such as Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, reverse hybridization, and Luminex analysis, which are becoming more widely utilized. In the future, whole genome sequencing, mass spectrometry, and microarray analysis may provide a wealth of information that can be used to specifically tailor the treatment of infectious diseases. Summary The implications of current trends in molecular infectious diseases are moving towards high-throughput, simple, array-type technologies that will provide a wealth of data regarding types of organisms present in a sample and the virulence factors/resistance determinants that influence the severity of disease. As a result of these developments, infectious diseases will be more accurately and effectively treated.",

We conducted a review of the published randomized, double-blind trials comparing corticosteroids and placebo in infections. Except in some trials of viral infections, sore throat, and cerebral cysticercosis, all patients also received active antimicrobial agents in addition to placebo or corticosteroids. For patients with bacterial meningitis, tuberculous meningitis, tuberculous pericarditis, severe typhoid fever, tetanus, or pneumocystis pneumonia with moderate to severe hypoxemia, treatment with corticosteroids improved patient survival (group 1 infections). For patients with bacterial arthritis, corticosteroids were also beneficial and reduced long-term disability (group 2 infections). For about a dozen other infections, corticosteroids significantly relieved symptoms (group 3 infections), and clinicians should consider using them if symptoms are substantial. Corticosteroids were harmful in 2 infections, viral hepatitis and cerebral malaria (group 5 infections). We conclude that corticosteroids are beneficial and safe for a wide variety of infections, although courses longer than 3 weeks should be withheld from patients with concomitant human immunodeficiency virus infection and low CD4 counts.",

Small (18-22 nucleotide), non-coding RNA transcripts called microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising candidates with extensive diagnostic potential, due to their role in numerous diseases, previously established methods for quantitation and their stability within biofluids. Despite efforts to identify, characterize and apply miRNA signatures as diagnostic markers in a range of non-infectious diseases, their application in infectious disease has advanced relatively slowly. Here, we outline the benefits that miRNA biomarkers offer to the diagnosis, management, and treatment of infectious diseases. Investigation of these novel biomarkers could advance the use of personalized medicine in infectious disease treatment, which raises important considerations for validating their use as diagnostic or prognostic markers. Finally, we discuss new and emerging miRNA detection platforms, with a focus on rapid, point-of-care testing, to evaluate the benefits and obstacles of miRNA biomarkers for infectious disease.",

    "abstract_text": "Large carnivores are of vital importance to the stability and integrity of most ecosystems, but recent declines in free-ranging populations have highlighted the potentially devastating effect of infectious diseases on their conservation. We reviewed the literature on infectious diseases of 34 large (maximum body mass of adults >20 kg) terrestrial carnivore species, 18 of which are considered to be threatened in the wild, and examined reports of antibody prevalence (seroprevalence) and cases of infection, mortality and population decline. Of 52 diseases examined, 44% were viral, 31% bacterial and the remainder were protozoal or fungal. Many infections were endemic in carnivores and/or infected multiple taxonomic families, with the majority probably occurring via inhalation or ingestion. Most disease studies consisted of serological surveys for disease antibodies, and antibody detection tended to be widespread implying that exposure to micro-organisms was common. Seroprevalence was higher in tropical than temperate areas, and marginally higher for infections known to occur in multiple carnivore groups. Confirmation of active infection via micro-organism recovery was less common for ursids than other taxonomic groups. Published descriptions of disease-induced population decline or extinction were rare, and most outbreaks were allegedly the result of direct transmission of rabies or canine distemper virus (CDV) from abundant carnivore species to less-common large carnivores. We conclude that the threat of disease epidemics in large carnivores may be serious if otherwise lethal infections are endemic in reservoir hosts and transmitted horizontally among taxa. To prevent or mitigate future population declines, research efforts should be aimed at identifying both the diseases of potential importance to large carnivores and the ecological conditions associated with their spread and severity.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract: White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a fatal disease of bats that hibernate. The etiologic agent of WNS is the fungus Geomyces destructans, which infects the skin and wing membranes. Over 1 million bats in six species in eastern North America have died from WNS since 2006, and as a result several species of bats may become endangered or extinct. Information is lacking on the pathogenesis of G. destructans and WNS, WNS transmission and maintenance, individual and site factors that contribute to the probability of an outbreak of WNS, and spatial dynamics of WNS spread in North America. We considered how descriptive and analytical epidemiology could be used to fill these information gaps, including a four-step (modified) outbreak investigation, application of a set of criteria (Hill's) for assessing causation, compartment models of disease dynamics, and spatial modeling. We cataloged and critiqued adaptive-management options that have been either previously proposed for WNS or were helpful in addressing other emerging diseases of wild animals. These include an ongoing program of prospective surveillance of bats and hibernacula for WNS, treatment of individual bats, increasing population resistance to WNS (through vaccines, immunomodulators, or other methods), improving probability of survival from starvation and dehydration associated with WNS, modifying hibernacula environments to eliminate G. destructans, culling individuals or populations, controlling anthropogenic spread of WNS, conserving genetic diversity of bats, and educating the public about bats and bat conservation issues associated with WNS. Resumen: El s\u00edndrome de nariz blanca (SNB) es una enfermedad fatal en murci\u00e9lagos que invernan. El agente etiol\u00f3gico del SNB es el hongo Geomyces destructans, que infecta la piel y las membranas alares. Desde 2006 m\u00e1s de 1 mill\u00f3n de murci\u00e9lagos de 6 especies han muerto de SNB, y como consecuencia varias especies de murci\u00e9lagos pueden estar en peligro o extintas. Se carece de informaci\u00f3n de la patog\u00e9nesis de G. destructans y SNB, la transmisi\u00f3n y mantenimiento de SNB, los factores individuales y de sitio que contribuyen a la probabilidad de una epidemia de SNB y de la din\u00e1mica espacial de la dispersi\u00f3n de SNB en Norte Am\u00e9rica.

For the most updated version of these guidelines, please go to https://www.idsociety.org/covid19guidelines. Background Accurate molecular diagnostic tests are necessary for confirming a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution, and public health\u2013level decision-making. The number of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests is rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance. Objective The IDSA\u2019s goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guidelines to assist clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients, and policy makers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, the society provides a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discusses the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlights important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing arena. Methods IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. Results The panel agreed on 15 diagnostic recommendations. Conclusions Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention, and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered low to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals who have had a known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institution-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.",

Possible infectious risks of xenotransplantation to the community at large are undefined but merit consideration. Xenotransplantation, the transplantation of viable cells, organs, or tissues between species, is proposed as a solution to the shortage of human organs for the treatment of organ failure. Recent advances in the management of immunological and metabolic barriers to pig-to-primate xenotransplantation improve the likelihood that clinical trials of xenotransplantation are feasible. The risk of infection in xenotransplantation due to organisms derived from nonhuman source animal species remains an important, and ill-defined, challenge to clinical xenotransplantation. As for all hosts, the risk for infection in the recipient after transplantation reflects the interaction between 2 factors: the epidemiology of infection including the dose, intensity, and virulence of the specific organisms present in the recipient and the graft; and the \"net state of immunosuppression\"\u2014a conceptual measure of any factors that may contribute to the risk for active infection, such as the intensity and duration of immunosuppression.1Fishman JA Infection in solid-organ transplant recipients.New England J Med. 2007; 357: 2601-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar,2Fishman JA Infection in organ transplantation.Am J Transplant. 2017; 17: 856-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar The transmission of infection with viable cells and tissues is efficient, notably for intracellular organisms and latent viruses, and is enhanced by the immunosuppression required to prevent graft rejection.

The terms \"xenosis,\" \"direct zoonosis,\" and \"xenozoonosis\" were coined to reflect the unique epidemiology of infection due to organisms potentially carried by nonhuman tissues. Experience with immunocompromised individuals suggests that certain types of pathogens are likely to emerge after transplantation (reviewed in1Fishman JA Infection in solid-organ transplant recipients.New England J Med. 2007; 357: 2601-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar,5Fishman JA Xenosis and xenotransplantation: addressing the infectious risks posed by an emerging technology.Kidney Int\u2014Suppl. 1997; 58: S41-S45PubMed Google Scholar,9Fishman J Patience C Xenotransplantation: infectious risk revisited.Am J Transplantation. 2004; 4: 1383-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar,10Fishman JA Infection in xenotransplantation.J Card Surg. 2001; 16: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Table 1). With transplant immunosuppression, both common pathogens of transplant recipients and unique porcine pathogens may emerge. Studies of xenotransplantation recipients and humans with exposure to pigs or pig products have not revealed any consistent patterns of infection. Early preclinical studies focused on the risk of infection when using miniature swine as xenograft donors for immunosuppressed nonhuman primates. Swine were found to be colonized by Actinomyces sp. and Streptococcus suis (J. Fishman, unpublished data) but otherwise had readily identified bacteria as the etiology of line-related bacteremia, pneumonia, or infections related to surgical procedures. The rate of antimicrobial-resistant infection in immunosuppressed recipients of porcine allografts and xenografts (baboons) was reduced through minimization of routine antimicrobial (first-generation cephalosporin surgical perioperative) prophylaxis in both the donor herd and in recipients. Isolation of resistant (fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin) bacteria is reduced by careful attention to routine antibiotic use in pig rearing. Intravenous ganciclovir was used for posttransplant prophylaxis against both porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) and baboon cytomegalovirus (BCMV).11Mueller N Sulling K Gollackner B et al.Reduced efficacy of ganciclovir against porcine and baboon cytomegalovirus in pig-to-baboon xenotransplantation.Am J Transplantation. 2003; 3: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,12Mueller NJ Barth RN Yamamoto S et al.Activation of cytomegalovirus in pig-to-primate organ xenotransplantation.J Virol. 2002; 76: 4734-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google ScholarTABLE 1Considerations in the microbiologic screening of swine as human xenograft donorsSwine organism typeExamplesMicrobiologic assays available?CommentsPathogens of normal humansInfluenza virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rabies, Mycoplasma spp.YesExclusion based on specific organismPathogens of human transplant recipientsToxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, parvovirusYesExclusion based on specific organismSimilar to common pathogens of human transplant recipientsPorcine cytomegalovirus, porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus, porcine adenovirusSomeValidated assays for human samples required; herpesviruses generally species-specific (see text)Unique swine pathogensPorcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV)FewUnknown risk for humans, validated assays for human samples required Open table in a new tab As for deceased donor screening, the goal of animal husbandry for xenotransplantation is to exclude potential pathogens for the human recipient and to prevent the introduction of new pathogens into breeding colonies from the environment and by care providers. It seems likely that the way in which the level of safety is achieved need not be uniform so long as the transplanted tissues do not pose a microbiologic hazard to the recipient. A potential benefit of xenotransplantation is that the screening paradigm can be more intensive than that used for human organ donors, limited only by the availability of microbiologic assays. Assays may be applied to an isolated herd of donor animals and/or to individual source animals. Validated assays for organisms in swine are largely limited to serologic testing, microscopic examination (stool, parasites), and standard microbiologic cultures for common pathogens, available in a small number of commercial or veterinary laboratories. Other assays (eg, nucleic acid testing for viruses) are more limited. Microbiological standards for pig husbandry should be considered \"dynamic\"\u2014subject to revision based on experimental and clinical data and reflecting the evolution of testing strategies. Based on experience, 2 separate lists of organisms may facilitate development of swine for xenotransplantation. One group of pathogens is excluded from breeding herds as a measure of pig health status. This list is guided by standard veterinary practice, including routine vaccines with the addition of microbially restricted and mammalian protein-free diets, filtered water, and special housing. Swine for xenotransplantation can be bred in \"biosecure facilities\" to prevent introduction of potential pig or human pathogens, isolated from other swine and animals, including rodents and birds, often with care providers gowned and gloved. Routine antimicrobial use should be restricted. It is not generally considered useful to develop gnotobiotic swine, which grow less well than swine with normal microbial complements. Genetic modification of swine to reduce graft rejection or for the elimination of endogenous retroviruses necessitates transgenic methods with nuclear transfer in sterile environments and subsequent embryo transfer to surrogate gilts.13Klymiuk N Aigner B Brem G Wolf E Genetic modification of pigs as organ donors for xenotransplantation.Mol Reprod Dev. 2010; 77: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Hryhorowicz M Zeyland J S\u0142omski R Lipi\u0144ski D Genetically modified pigs as organ donors for xenotransplantation.Mol Biotechnol. 2017; 59: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Yang L Guell M Niu D et al.Genome-wide inactivation of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs).Science. 2015; 350: 1101-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 16Sachs DH Galli C Genetic manipulation in pigs.Curr Opin Organ Transplant. 2009; 14: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Phelps CJ Koike C Vaught TD et al.Production of alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase-deficient pigs.Science. 2003; 299: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar A second list of potential swine-derived organisms was created to identify potential pathogens based on experience with immunosuppressed human allotransplant recipients and pig-to-primate xenotransplantation (Table 2).

Open table in a new tab Viral infection is common after organ transplantation due to the efficient transmission of viruses with viable cells and suppression of T lymphocyte\u2013mediated antiviral immune responses in the MHC-disparate graft. Multiple factors increase viral replication subsequently including immunosuppression, graft rejection, proinflammatory cytokines, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. In xenotransplantation, these factors may also contribute to replication of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) and porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus (PLHV-1, -2, -3). Additional infections observed in immunosuppressed swine, as well as normal animals, include porcine circovirus (PCV) and adenovirus. The diagnosis of infections due to these common porcine organisms in primate recipients has been addressed by the development of sensitive, quantitative NAT assays for PERV, PLHV, PCMV, and PCV. Each virus is associated with a specific clinical syndrome in swine and in nonhuman primate xenograft recipients. PCMV causes infection restricted to the porcine renal xenografts with endothelial activation, consumptive coagulopathy, and early graft loss.12Mueller NJ Barth RN Yamamoto S et al.Activation of cytomegalovirus in pig-to-primate organ xenotransplantation.J Virol. 2002; 76: 4734-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,20Mueller NJ Kuwaki K Dor FJMF et al.Reduction of consumptive coagulopathy using porcine cytomegalovirus-free cardiac porcine grafts in pig-to-primate xenotransplantation.Transplantation. 2004; 78: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Gollackner B Mueller NJ Houser S et al.Porcine cytomegalovirus and coagulopathy in pig-to-primate xenotransplantation.Transplantation. 2003; 75: 1841-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Yamada K Tasaki M Sekijima M et al.Porcine cytomegalovirus infection is associated with early rejection of kidney grafts in a pig to baboon xenotransplantation model.Transplantation. 2014; 98: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 23Sekijima M Waki S Sahara H et al.Results of life-supporting galactosyltransferase knockout kidneys in cynomolgus monkeys using two different sources of galactosyltransferase knockout Swine.Transplantation. 2014; 98: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar PCMV can be excluded from pig colonies by early weaning and careful isolation.24Clark DA Fryer JF Tucker AW et al.Porcine cytomegalovirus in pigs being bred for xenograft organs: progress towards control.Xenotransplantation. 2003; 10: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Mueller NJ Kuwaki K Knosalla C et al.Early weaning of piglets fails to exclude porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus.Xenotransplantation. 2005; 12: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Edington N Broad S Wrathall AE Done JT Superinfection with porcine cytomegalovirus initiating transplacental infection.Vet Microbiol. 1988; 16: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Tucker AW Galbraith D McEwan P Onions D Evaluation of porcine cytomegalovirus as a potential zoonotic agent in xenotransplantation.Transplant Proc. 1999; 31: 915Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar PLHV has been associated with a form of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in immunosuppressed swine undergoing stem cell transplantation.28Dor FJ Doucette KE Mueller NJ et al.Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease after allogeneic transplantation of the spleen in miniature swine.Transplantation. 2004; 78: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,29Doucette K Dor FJ Wilkinson RA et al.Gene expression of porcine lymphotrophic herpesvirus-1 in miniature Swine with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.Transplantation. 2007; 83: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar Porcine herpesviruses appear to be relatively species-specific; active graft infection is not associated with systemic infection in primate recipients of xenografts, although shed virus may be detected in circulation.27Tucker AW Galbraith D McEwan P Onions D Evaluation of porcine cytomegalovirus as a potential zoonotic agent in xenotransplantation.Transplant Proc. 1999; 31: 915Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,30Whitteker JL Dudani AK Tackaberry ES Human fibroblasts are permissive for porcine cytomegalovirus in vitro.Transplantation. 2008; 86: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar Other viral infections tend to be self-limited in normal swine.

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT Outbreaks of emerging infectious disease are a constant threat. In the last 10 years, there have been outbreaks of 2009 influenza A (H1N1), Ebola virus disease, and Zika virus. Stigma associated with infectious disease can be a barrier to adopting healthy behaviors, leading to more severe health problems, ongoing disease transmission, and difficulty controlling infectious disease outbreaks. Much has been learned about infectious disease and stigma in the context of nearly 4 decades of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pandemic. In this paper, we define stigma, discuss its relevance to infectious disease outbreaks, including how individuals and communities can be affected. Adapting lessons learned from the rich literature on HIV-related stigma, we propose a strategy for reducing stigma during infectious disease outbreaks such as Ebola virus disease and Zika virus. The implementation of brief, practical strategies such as the ones proposed here might help reduce stigma and facilitate more effective control of emerging infectious diseases.",

    "title": "The Effect of Global Warming on Infectious Diseases",
    "abstract_text": "Global warming has various effects on human health. The main indirect effects are on infectious diseases. Although the effects on infectious diseases will be detected worldwide, the degree and types of the effect are different, depending on the location of the respective countries and socioeconomical situations. Among infectious diseases, water- and foodborne infectious diseases and vector-borne infectious diseases are two main categories that are forecasted to be most affected. The effect on vector-borne infectious diseases such as malaria and dengue fever is mainly because of the expansion of the infested areas of vector mosquitoes and increase in the number and feeding activity of infected mosquitoes. There will be increase in the number of cases with water- and foodborne diarrhoeal diseases. Even with the strongest mitigation procedures, global warming cannot be avoided for decades. Therefore, implementation of adaptation measures to the effect of global warming is the most practical action we can take. It is generally accepted that the impacts of global warming on infectious diseases have not been apparent at this point yet in East Asia. However, these impacts will appear in one form or another if global warming continues to progress in future. Further research on the impacts of global warming on infectious diseases and on future prospects should be conducted.",

    "title": "The Genetic Theory of Infectious Diseases: A Brief History and Selected Illustrations",
    "abstract_text": "Until the mid-nineteenth century, life expectancy at birth averaged 20 years worldwide, owing mostly to childhood fevers. The germ theory of diseases then gradually overcame the belief that diseases were intrinsic. However, around the turn of the twentieth century, asymptomatic infection was discovered to be much more common than clinical disease. Paradoxically, this observation barely challenged the newly developed notion that infectious diseases were fundamentally extrinsic. Moreover, interindividual variability in the course of infection was typically explained by the emerging immunological (or somatic) theory of infectious diseases, best illustrated by the impact of vaccination. This powerful explanation is, however, best applicable to reactivation and secondary infections, particularly in adults; it can less easily account for interindividual variability in the course of primary infection during childhood. Population and clinical geneticists soon proposed a complementary hypothesis, a germline genetic theory of infectious diseases. Over the past century, this idea has gained some support, particularly among clinicians and geneticists, but has also encountered resistance, particularly among microbiologists and immunologists. We present here the genetic theory of infectious diseases and briefly discuss its history and the challenges encountered during its emergence in the context of the apparently competing but actually complementary microbiological and immunological theories. We also illustrate its recent achievements by highlighting inborn errors of immunity underlying eight life-threatening infectious diseases of children and young adults. Finally, we consider the far-reaching biological and clinical implications of the ongoing human genetic dissection of severe infectious diseases.",

    "title": "The rise and fall of infectious disease in a warmer world",
    "abstract_text": "<ns4:p>Now-outdated estimates proposed that climate change should have increased the number of people at risk of malaria, yet malaria and several other infectious diseases have declined. Although some diseases have increased as the climate has warmed, evidence for widespread climate-driven disease expansion has not materialized, despite increased research attention. Biological responses to warming depend on the non-linear relationships between physiological performance and temperature, called the thermal response curve. This leads performance to rise and fall with temperature. Under climate change, host species and their associated parasites face extinction if they cannot either thermoregulate or adapt by shifting phenology or geographic range. Climate change might also affect disease transmission through increases or decreases in host susceptibility and infective stage (and vector) production, longevity, and pathology. Many other factors drive disease transmission, especially economics, and some change in time along with temperature, making it hard to distinguish whether temperature drives disease or just correlates with disease drivers. Although it is difficult to predict how climate change will affect infectious disease, an ecological approach can help meet the challenge.</ns4:p>",

This review summarises recent findings on and emerging models of the biological roles of the double-edged sword interleukin-13 (IL-13), which have been principally obtained from studies in mice that are deficient for IL-13, or its components. IL-13-mediated functions not only contribute to the susceptible phenotype in Leishmania major infection but also seem to play a protective role in chronic leishmaniasis. Moreover, IL-13 plays a key protective role in the expulsion of helminths from the gut while also actively contributing to the pathology in schistosomiasis. In allergic asthma, IL-13 has also been found to be a key factor. Therapeutic administration of an IL-13 inhibitor in mice successfully prevents both the allergic disease phenotype and schistosoma egg-induced lung pathology. If this scenario holds true in humans, we soon may have an efficient drug for treatment of IL-13-mediated diseases. BioEssays 22:646\u2013656, 2000. \u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract_text": "Outbreaks of infectious disease can ruin conservation programs. In order to minimize catastrophic disease outbreaks, it is important to understand the dynamic relationship between populations of threatened hosts and their parasites. The dynamics of the host-parasite relationship are ineluctably linked to host-population density. Intensive conservation management programs are often characterized by small population size. In small host populations, the dynamics of host parasite relationships are particularly fragile and disease outbreaks will tend to die out rapidly. The most significant disease risks for intensive management programs will probably occur when hosts are chronically stressed, when they are exposed to novel pathogens, and when herd immunity is lost. Biologically diverse parasites will never be entirely eliminated from intensively managed wild life. Rather, one of the great challenges facing conservation biologists is to learn how to manage the natural and healthy relationship between parasites and their hosts. The population dynamics of host-parasite relationships must be integrated into species survival and recovery plans.",

    "abstract_text": "The emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms is a great public health concern and has triggered an urgent need to develop alternative antibiotics. Chitosan microparticles (CM), derived from chitosan, have been shown to reduce E. coli O157:H7 shedding in a cattle model, indicating potential use as an alternative antimicrobial agent. However, the underlying mechanism of CM on reducing the shedding of this pathogen remains unclear. To understand the mode of action, we studied molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial activity of CM using in vitro and in vivo methods. We report that CM are an effective bactericidal agent with capability to disrupt cell membranes. Binding assays and genetic studies with an ompA mutant strain demonstrated that outer membrane protein OmpA of E. coli O157:H7 is critical for CM binding, and this binding activity is coupled with a bactericidal effect of CM. This activity was also demonstrated in an animal model using cows with uterine diseases. CM treatment effectively reduced shedding of intrauterine pathogenic E. coli (IUPEC) in the uterus compared to antibiotic treatment. Since Shiga-toxins encoded in the genome of bacteriophage is often overexpressed during antibiotic treatment, antibiotic therapy is generally not recommended because of high risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome. However, CM treatment did not induce bacteriophage or Shiga-toxins in E. coli O157:H7; suggesting that CM can be a potential candidate to treat infections caused by this pathogen. This work establishes an underlying mechanism whereby CM exert antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo, providing significant insight for the treatment of diseases caused by a broad spectrum of pathogens including antibiotic resistant microorganisms.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract Background Europeans represent the majority of international travellers and clinicians encountering returned patients have an essential role in recognizing, and communicating travel-associated public health risks. Methods To investigate the morbidity of travel associated infectious diseases in European travellers, we analysed diagnoses with demographic, clinical and travel-related predictors of disease, in 6957 ill returned travellers who presented in 2008 to EuroTravNet centres with a presumed travel associated condition. Results Gastro-intestinal (GI) diseases accounted for 33% of illnesses, followed by febrile systemic illnesses (20%), dermatological conditions (12%) and respiratory illnesses (8%). There were 3 deaths recorded; a sepsis caused by Escherichia coli pyelonephritis, a dengue shock syndrome and a Plasmodium falciparum malaria. GI conditions included bacterial acute diarrhea (6.9%), as well as giardiasis and amebasis (2.3%). Among febrile systemic illnesses with identified pathogens, malaria (5.4%) accounted for most cases followed by dengue (1.9%) and others including chikungunya, rickettsial diseases, leptospirosis, brucellosis, Epstein Barr virus infections, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and viral hepatitis. Dermatological conditions were dominated by bacterial infections, arthropod bites, cutaneous larva migrans and animal bites requiring rabies post-exposure prophylaxis and also leishmaniasis, myasis, tungiasis and one case of leprosy. Respiratory illness included 112 cases of tuberculosis including cases of multi-drug resistant or extensively drug resistant tuberculosis, 104 cases of influenza like illness, and 5 cases of Legionnaires disease. Sexually transmitted infections (STI) accounted for 0.6% of total diagnoses and included HIV infection and syphilis. A total of 165 cases of potentially vaccine preventable diseases were reported. Purpose of travel and destination specific risk factors was identified for several diagnoses such as Chagas disease in immigrant travellers from South America and P. falciparum malaria in immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa. Travel within Europe was also associated with health risks with distinctive profiles for Eastern and Western Europe. Conclusions In 2008, a broad spectrum of travel associated diseases were diagnosed at EuroTravNet core sites. Diagnoses varied according to regions visited by ill travellers. The spectrum of travel associated morbidity also shows that there is a need to dispel the misconception that travel, close to home, in Europe, is without significant health risk.",

    "abstract_text": "Background Maternal mortality is a major health problem concentrated in resource-poor regions. Accurate data on its causes using rigorous methods is lacking, but is essential to guide policy-makers and health professionals to reduce this intolerable burden. The aim of this study was to accurately describe the causes of maternal death in order to contribute to its reduction, in one of the regions of the world with the highest maternal mortality ratios. Methods and Findings We conducted a prospective study between October 2002 and December 2004 on the causes of maternal death in a tertiary-level referral hospital in Maputo, Mozambique, using complete autopsies with histological examination. HIV detection was done by virologic and serologic tests, and malaria was diagnosed by histological and parasitological examination. During 26 mo there were 179 maternal deaths, of which 139 (77.6%) had a complete autopsy and formed the basis of this analysis. Of those with test results, 65 women (52.8%) were HIV-positive. Obstetric complications accounted for 38.2% of deaths; haemorrhage was the most frequent cause (16.6%). Nonobstetric conditions accounted for 56.1% of deaths; HIV/AIDS, pyogenic bronchopneumonia, severe malaria, and pyogenic meningitis were the most common causes (12.9%, 12.2%, 10.1% and 7.2% respectively). Mycobacterial infection was found in 12 (8.6%) maternal deaths. Conclusions In this tertiary hospital in Mozambique, infectious diseases accounted for at least half of all maternal deaths, even though effective treatment is available for the four leading causes, HIV/AIDS, pyogenic bronchopneumonia, severe malaria, and pyogenic meningitis. These observations highlight the need to implement effective and available prevention tools, such as intermittent preventive treatment and insecticide-treated bed-nets for malaria, antiretroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS, or vaccines and effective antibiotics for pneumococcal and meningococcal diseases. Deaths due to obstetric causes represent a failure of health-care systems and require urgent improvement.",

However, most studies only have focused on clinical data. Evidence Acquisition: In this short review, the psychological effects of COVID-19 and its association with anxiety were examined. Accordingly, the electronic databases, including PubMed, Medline, Elsevier, and Science Direct were reviewed for relevant studies that have conducted since 2007. Results: The current study was carried out to indicate that COVID-19 has negative psychological problems other than mortality. A review of the studies performed in other parts of the world showed that COVID-19 has caused several psychological impacts, including increased anxiety. Conclusions: By an increase in the prevalence rate of COVID-19 and its resulted restrictions, the level of anxiety increases, as well; therefore, raising public awareness of the disease and providing positive psychological programs in the media aimed at controlling stress can reduce anxiety in society.",

Previously considered a pollutant from car exhausts, NO has now been implicated in many physiological processes. Here we review the dual roles of NO in infection\u2014as a critical agent of host defence but also as a central mediator of pathogenesis\u2014using septic shock, bacterial meningitis, and malaria to illustrate some current concepts and controversies. We have limited our discussion of the important physiological functions of NO in the cardiovascular and neurological systems to instances where these impinge on its role in infectious diseases.\n\nNO is formed by the oxidative deamination of the amino acid L-arginine by nitric oxide synthases (NOS) (fig 1). Three isoforms of this enzyme are described (table 1).1 Neuronal NOS (nNOS or NOS1) is constitutively present in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, where NO acts as a neurotransmitter. Endothelial NOS (eNOS or NOS3) is constitutively expressed by endothelium and other cell types and is involved in cardiovascular homeostasis. In contrast, inducible NOS (iNOS or NOS2) is absent in resting cells, but the gene is rapidly expressed in response to stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines. Once present, iNOS synthesises 100\u20131000 times more NO than the constitutive enzymes and does so for prolonged periods; the production of NO by eNOS and nNOS has been likened to a dripping tap, while that by iNOS to a fire hose. This high concentration of NO may inhibit a large variety of microbes, but may also potentially damage the host, thereby contributing to pathology.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 \nConversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline plus nitric oxide as catalysed by nitric oxide synthases.

    "abstract_text": "BRIEF PROPOSALS THE EVOLUTION AND ERADICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES T. AIDAN COCKBURN, M.D.* Many years ago I asked a distinguished scientist a question: \"Where did measles come from?\" He replied, \"Measles has always been there.\" I then asked, \"How long is always?\" and was told that \"always is always.\" This was not a very satisfying conversation, but it did illuminate brightly a very common form of thinking among physicians with regard to the origin ofthe diseases they handle. A disease like measles does not consist merely ofthe measles virus, or ofthe human host, or ofthe environment in which both live; it is a combination ofall three. Unless the proper virus, the proper host, and the proper environment are brought together at the same time, there will be no measles. Since man did not exist ten million years ago, obviouslymeasles could not have existed at that time. More than 50 per cent ofthe content ofmy book The Evolution and Eradication ofInfectious Diseases1 is devoted to a series oftheories which try to show how and when infectious diseases in general and those ofman in particular evolved through the years since the origin oflife on earth. The basic assumption is that all parasites are descended from organisms that were once free-living. Parasites can spread in two main ways. In \"horizontal\" spread, parasites are transmitted from animals to animals or species to species in a short period oftime, as during a measles epidemic or in the zoonoses when an infection is transmitted from an animal to a human being. \"Vertical\" spread takes place over millions ofyears. A population ofhost animals will break up into smaller groups and eventually evolve into new species. The parasites to which the original population was host will, ofcourse, accompany the animals to which they were attached, so that in the course of time a series of new species will appear which all carry the same parasites. For example, the ancestral host of all the primates must have had a series ofparasites which have been handed down, little changed, to all the primate radiation. Thus man, apes, and monkeys are all infected with lice, malaria, intestinal protozoa, pinworms, etc., which vary only slightly according to the families ofthe host. Modern theory holds that man evolved over some millions of years in Africa. Many of his original infections must therefore have evolved on that continent. However, as man spread around the world some two hundred thousand years ago, some ofthe para- * Assistant Commissioner of Health, Office of Board ofHealth, City Hall, Cincinnati 2, Ohio. 1 Johns Hopkins Press, 1963. 498 BriefProposals Perspectives in Biology and Medicine \u00b7 Summer 1964 sites which required intermediate hosts found only in Africa would have been unable to survive on the new continents. In addition, migrant early man became exposed to new zoonoses in the fresh lands he occupied. In this way a pattern ofhost-parasite relationships would have been set up which survived until about ten thousand years ago. At that time two major revolutions occurred: man discovered how to domesticate animals, and he invented agriculture. This in turn led to a vast increase in population and the founding of large cities. Urbanization permitted, for the first time, the permanent establishment of organisms that exist solely by rapid transfer from one man to another\u2014like measles, smallpox, and the common cold. Since the organisms of these \"crowd\" diseases often resemble those ofdomestic animals, the assumption has beenmade that most were derived from this source. The evolution ofdiseases in the past is intimately related to the actions we take against them today. Within recent years a new concept of \"eradication\" is replacing the \"control \" ofinfectious disease as a desirable target. By eradication is meant the complete wiping -out ofa pathogen causing a disease so that it cannot come back and no further measures against it are required. Obviously, the problem oferadication is closely tied up with the evolution ofthe pathogen, for, ifan organism has an identical relationship with that ofsome animal host, then eradicating it from the human host is not enough. Ifthe human parasitehas close relationship with another in some animal host, then the possibility exists that the organism may evolve again from these...",

    "abstract_text": "Today, 10 years after the discovery of IL\u20108, chemokines ( chemo tactic cyto kines ) are seen as the stimuli that largely control leucocyte migration. Chemokines are low molecular weight chemoattractant cytokines secreted by a variety of cells, including leucocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and numerous other cell types. They are produced in response to exogenous stimuli, such as viruses and bacterial LPS, and endogenous stimuli, such as IL\u20101, TNF and IFN. These factors mediate chemotaxis and leucocyte activation. They also regulate leucocyte extravasation from the blood and/or lymph vessel luminal surface to the tissue space, the site of inflammation. There is no doubt that chemokines and chemokine receptors are critical for defence against infectious pathogens. It is also clear that these pathogens have evolved to accommodate the workings of the host immune system. Survival of these infectious agents appears dependent upon strategies that can evade, suppress, counteract or otherwise confound the constellation of host responses to invading pathogens. In this regard, the chemokines and their receptors are a major target. Reviewed in the present paper are several examples in which microbial pathogens have usurped the mammalian chemokine system to subvert the host immune response.",

Virulence factor genes for diarrheagenic Escherichia coli were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Enteropathogens were identified in 56% of patients and 16% of control subjects. The isolation rate was 65% for patients with symptoms for <1 week and for travelers; >1 pathogen was found in 11% of patients. The most frequent enteropathogens were Campylobacter (13% of patients), Clostridium difficile (13%), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (8%), Salmonella (7%), Shigella (4%), Blastocystis hominis (4%), calicivirus (3%), rotavirus (3%), enteroaggregative E. coli (2%), Aeromonas (2%), Giardia intestinalis (2%), Cryptosporidium (2%), and astrovirus (2%). Less frequently isolated (\u22641% of patients) were verotoxigenic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enteroinvasive E. coli, Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar, microsporidia, and adenovirus. Fifty percent of the patients were hospitalized, and 43% needed intravenous fluids. The median duration of diarrhea was 14 days. Clinical features were not helpful for predicting the etiology of diarrhea.",

Serum therapy was largely abandoned in the 1940s because of the toxicity associated with the administration of heterologous sera and the introduction of effective antimicrobial chemotherapy. Recent advances in the technology of monoclonal antibody production provide the means to generate human antibody reagents and reintroduce antibody therapies, while avoiding the toxicities associated with serum therapy. Because of the versatility of antibodies, antibody-based therapies could, in theory, be developed against any existing pathogen. The advantages of antibody-based therapies include versatility, low toxicity, pathogen specificity, enhancement of immune function, and favorable pharmacokinetics; the disadvantages include high cost, limited usefulness against mixed infections, and the need for early and precise microbiologic diagnosis. The potential of antibodies as antiinfective agents has not been fully tapped. Antibody-based therapies constitute a potentially useful option against newly emergent pathogens.",

In addition to genetic factors, environmental triggers (in particular viruses, bacteria and other infectious pathogens) are thought to play a major role in the development of autoimmune diseases. Methodology: We searched PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus without time limits for relevant articles. Results: In this review, we (i) describe the ways in which an infectious agent can initiate or exacerbate autoimmunity; (ii) discuss the evidence linking certain infectious agents to autoimmune diseases in humans; and (iii) describe the animal models used to study the link between infection and autoimmunity. Conclusions: Besides genetic predisposition to autoimmunity, viral and bacterial infections are known to be involved in the initiation and promotion of autoimmune diseases. These studies suggest that pathogens can trigger autoimmunity through molecular mimicry and their adjuvant effects during initiation of disease, and can promote autoimmune responses through bystander activation or epitope spreading via inflammation and/or superantigens.",

When a pathogen meets its host, a series of intricate intracellular interactions shape the outcome of the infection. The understanding of these host\u2013pathogen interactions is crucial for the development of treatments and preventive measures against infectious diseases. Over the past decade, proteomic approaches have become prime contributors to the discovery and understanding of host\u2013pathogen interactions that represent anti\u2010 and pro\u2010pathogenic cellular responses. Here, we review these proteomic methods and their application to studying viral and bacterial intracellular pathogens. We examine approaches for defining spatial and temporal host\u2013pathogen protein interactions upon infection of a host cell. Further expanding the understanding of proteome organization during an infection, we discuss methods that characterize the regulation of host and pathogen proteomes through alterations in protein abundance, localization, and post\u2010translational modifications. Finally, we highlight bioinformatic tools available for analyzing such proteomic datasets, as well as novel strategies for integrating proteomics with other omic tools, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, to obtain a systems\u2010level understanding of infectious diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "Background Water plays an important role in the transmission of many infectious diseases, which pose a great burden on global public health. However, the global distribution of these water-associated infectious diseases and underlying factors remain largely unexplored. Methods and Findings Based on the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON), a global database including water-associated pathogens and diseases was developed. In this study, reported outbreak events associated with corresponding water-associated infectious diseases from 1991 to 2008 were extracted from the database. The location of each reported outbreak event was identified and geocoded into a GIS database. Also collected in the GIS database included geo-referenced socio-environmental information including population density (2000), annual accumulated temperature, surface water area, and average annual precipitation. Poisson models with Bayesian inference were developed to explore the association between these socio-environmental factors and distribution of the reported outbreak events. Based on model predictions a global relative risk map was generated. A total of 1,428 reported outbreak events were retrieved from the database. The analysis suggested that outbreaks of water-associated diseases are significantly correlated with socio-environmental factors. Population density is a significant risk factor for all categories of reported outbreaks of water-associated diseases; water-related diseases (e.g., vector-borne diseases) are associated with accumulated temperature; water-washed diseases (e.g., conjunctivitis) are inversely related to surface water area; both water-borne and water-related diseases are inversely related to average annual rainfall. Based on the model predictions, \"hotspots\" of risks for all categories of water-associated diseases were explored. Conclusions At the global scale, water-associated infectious diseases are significantly correlated with socio-environmental factors, impacting all regions which are affected disproportionately by different categories of water-associated infectious diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "Why are religions far more numerous in the tropics compared with the temperate areas? We propose, as an answer, that more religions have emerged and are maintained in the tropics because, through localized coevolutionary races with hosts, infectious diseases select for three anticontagion behaviours: in-group assortative sociality; out-group avoidance; and limited dispersal. These behaviours, in turn, create intergroup boundaries that effectively fractionate, isolate and diversify an original culture leading to the genesis of two or more groups from one. Religion is one aspect of a group's culture that undergoes this process. If this argument is correct then, across the globe, religion diversity should correlate positively with infectious disease diversity, reflecting an evolutionary history of antagonistic coevolution between parasites and hosts and subsequent religion genesis. We present evidence that supports this model: for a global sample of traditional societies, societal range size is reduced in areas with more pathogens compared with areas with few pathogens, and in contemporary countries religion diversity is positively related to two measures of parasite stress.",

(Murray CJ et al 2012 Lancet380, 2197-2223. (doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61689-4)) estimated country-level morbidity and mortality associated with a variety of factors, including infectious diseases, for the years 1990 and 2010. Unlike other databases that report disease prevalence or count outbreaks per country, Murray et al. report health impacts in per-person disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), allowing comparison across diseases with lethal and sublethal health effects. We investigated the spatial and temporal relationships between DALYs lost to infectious disease and potential demographic, economic, environmental and biotic drivers, for the 60 intermediate-sized countries where data were available and comparable. Most drivers had unique associations with each disease. For example, temperature was positively associated with some diseases and negatively associated with others, perhaps due to differences in disease agent thermal optima, transmission modes and host species identities. Biodiverse countries tended to have high disease burdens, consistent with the expectation that high diversity of potential hosts should support high disease transmission. Contrary to the dilution effect hypothesis, increases in biodiversity over time were not correlated with improvements in human health, and increases in forestation over time were actually associated with increased disease burden. Urbanization and wealth were associated with lower burdens for many diseases, a pattern that could arise from increased access to sanitation and healthcare in cities and increased investment in healthcare. The importance of urbanization and wealth helps to explain why most infectious diseases have become less burdensome over the past three decades, and points to possible levers for further progress in improving global public health.This article is part of the themed issue 'Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications'.",

Recent advances in the understanding of both the cellular and molecular mechanisms of virus replication have provided the basis for novel therapeutic strategies. Several hundred natural products have been isolated for screening and identifying antiviral activity, and some have been shown to have great medicinal value in preventing and/or ameliorating viral diseases in preclinical and clinical trials. There are innumerable potentially useful medicinal plants and herbs waiting to be evaluated and exploited for therapeutic applications against genetically and functionally diverse virus families.

Effective public health control of these diseases would depend upon critical knowledge of the vector biology of the ticks that transmit them. Rocky Mountain spotted fever and the human ehrlichioses are life-threatening yet treatable diseases. A major problem remains establishment of the diagnosis when treatment decisions are being made. Clinical manifestations, other than erythema migrans for Lyme borreliosis, do not provide strong diagnostic clues. Ehrlichiae or babesiae are often not detected in peripheral blood smears. Frequently there are no antibodies to these diverse agents at the time of presentation, and isolation does not yield sensitive and timely results. Polymerase chain reaction, still a research tool, promises the greatest sensitivity, specificity, and timeliness. Prevention by vaccines is not yet a reality, although OspA-based vaccines offer hope for the prevention of Lyme disease.",

Due to the strong interactions present, households are one of the most important heterogeneities to consider, both in terms of predicting epidemic severity and as a target for intervention. We consider these effects in the context of pandemic influenza in Great Britain, and find that there is significant local (ward-level) variation in the basic reproductive ratio, with some regions predicted to suffer 50% faster growth rate of infection than the mean. Childhood vaccination was shown to be highly effective at controlling an epidemic, generally outperforming random vaccination and substantially reducing the variation between regions; only nine out of over 10 000 wards did not obey this rule and these can be identified as demographically atypical regions. Since these benefits of childhood vaccination are a product of correlations between household size and number of dependent children in the household, our results are qualitatively robust for a variety of disease scenarios.",

Analysis of large-scale case-control studies provides one of the most direct means of identifying human genetic variants that currently impact on susceptibility to particular infectious diseases. For over 50 years candidate gene studies have been used to identify loci for many major causes of human infectious mortality, including malaria, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, bacterial pneumonia and hepatitis. But with the advent of genome-wide approaches, many new loci have been identified in diverse populations. Genome-wide linkage studies identified a few loci, but genome-wide association studies are proving more successful, and both exome and whole-genome sequencing now offer a revolutionary increase in power. Opinions differ on the extent to which the genetic component to common disease susceptibility is encoded by multiple high frequency or rare variants, and the heretical view that most infectious diseases might even be monogenic has been advocated recently. Review of findings to date suggests that the genetic architecture of infectious disease susceptibility may be importantly different from that of non-infectious diseases, and it is suggested that natural selection may be the driving force underlying this difference.",

Sphingolipids are also relevant to infectious diseases. Various types of pathogens exploit the sphingolipids of host cells as membrane receptors. Sphingolipid metabolites regulate pathogen infection and host defense: for instance, a specific glycosphingolipid acts as an endogenous ligand for activation of natural killer T cells. Lipid-rafts of host cells serve as platforms also for infection signaling and entry of intracellular parasites. Moreover, some post-infectious autoimmune diseases result from production of antibodies cross-reacting with mammalian sphingolipids. Differences in the pathways of sphingolipid metabolism between mammals and non-mammals are good clues for rational development of new anti-infectious disease drugs.

    "abstract_text": "Leptin, a pleiotropic protein has long been recognized to play an important role in the regulation of energy homeostasis, metabolism, neuroendocrine function, and other physiological functions through its effects on the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Leptin is secreted by adipose tissue and encoded by the obese (ob) gene. Leptin acts as a central mediator which regulates immunity as well as nutrition. Importantly, leptin can modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. Leptin deficiency/resistance is associated with dysregulation of cytokine production, increased susceptibility towards infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, malnutrition and inflammatory responses. Malnutrition induces a state of immunodeficiency and an inclination to death from communicable diseases. Infectious diseases are the disease of poor who invariably suffer from malnutrition that could result from reduced serum leptin levels. Thus, leptin has been placed at the centre of many interrelated functions in various pathogenic conditions, such as bacterial, viruses and parasitic infections. We review herein, the recent advances on the role of leptin in malnutrition in pathogenesis of infectious diseases with a particular emphasis on parasitic diseases such as Leishmaniasis, Trypanosomiasis, Amoebiasis, and Malaria.",

    "abstract_text": "The hypothesis that inborn errors of immunity underlie infectious diseases is gaining experimental support. However, the apparent modes of inheritance of predisposition or resistance differ considerably among diseases and among studies. A coherent genetic architecture of infectious diseases is lacking. We suggest here that life\u2010threatening infectious diseases in childhood, occurring in the course of primary infection, result mostly from individually rare but collectively diverse single\u2010gene variations of variable clinical penetrance, whereas the genetic component of predisposition to secondary or reactivation infections in adults is more complex. This model is consistent with (i) the high incidence of most infectious diseases in early childhood, followed by a steady decline; (ii) theoretical modeling of the impact of monogenic or polygenic predisposition on the incidence distribution of infectious diseases before reproductive age; (iii) available molecular evidence from both monogenic and complex genetics of infectious diseases in children and adults; (iv) current knowledge of immunity to primary and secondary or latent infections; (v) the state of the art in the clinical genetics of noninfectious pediatric and adult diseases; and (vi) evolutionary data for the genes underlying single\u2010gene and complex disease risk. With the recent advent of new\u2010generation deep resequencing, this model of single\u2010gene variations underlying severe pediatric infectious diseases is experimentally testable.",

    "abstract_text": "Transmission of respiratory infectious diseases in humans, for instance influenza, occurs by several modes. Respiratory droplets provide a vector of transmission of an infectious pathogen that may contribute to different transmission modes. An epidemiological model incorporating the dynamics of inhalable respiratory droplets is developed to assess their relevance in the infectious process. Inhalable respiratory droplets are divided into respirable droplets, with droplet diameter less than 10 microm, and inspirable droplets, with diameter in the range 10-100 microm: both droplet classes may be inhaled or settle. Droplet dynamics is determined by their physical properties (size), whereas population dynamics is determined by, among other parameters, the pathogen infectivity and the host contact rates. Three model influenza epidemic scenarios, mediated by different airborne or settled droplet classes, are analysed. The scenarios are distinguished by the characteristic times associated with breathing at contact and with hand-to-face contact. The scenarios suggest that airborne transmission, mediated by respirable droplets, provides the dominant transmission mode in middle and long-term epidemics, whereas inspirable droplets, be they airborne or settled, characterize short-term epidemics with high attack rates. The model neglects close-contact transmission by droplet sprays (direct projection onto facial mucous membranes), retaining close-contact transmission by inspirable droplets.",

Background The prevalence of infectious diseases, especially viral hepatitis, among the homeless population is largely unknown. Study This study consists of a retrospective analysis of the history and laboratory data collected from all homeless veterans admitted to a Veterans Administration (VA) domiciliary from May 1995 to March 2000. Results Of the homeless veterans admitted to a VA domiciliary program, 597 of 829 were screened for markers of all four infectious diseases. The overall prevalence of anti\u2013hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, and positive result for purified protein derivative (PPD), anti-HIV antibody, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) were 41.7%, 20.6%, 1.84% and 1.17%, respectively. At least one of the four markers was positive in 52.6% and more than one in 12%. Co-infection with HCV occurred commonly in veterans who were positive for anti-HIV (72.7%) and HBsAg (57.1%). Four self-reported major risk factors (intravenous drug use, alcohol abuse, previous imprisonment, and prior stay in a shelter) were evaluated. Multivariate analysis indicates that intravenous drug use and anti-HBs reactivity are independent risk factors for HCV infection, HCV infection for anti\u2013hepatitis B surface antibody reactivity, and older age for PPD positivity. Conclusions Chronic hepatitis C and co-infections are common among the homeless population. Patients infected with HIV and hepatitis B virus frequently are co-infected with HCV. Infections frequently are associated with certain identifiable risk factors.",

The history of passive immunization with antibodies to prevent or treat infectious diseases is a story of different eras.

This empirical process provided the resources and reagents used to describe and characterize humoral immunity, better define the chemical properties and structure of antibodies, and extend the clinical use of immunoglobulin products to treat or prevent multiple viral and bacterial diseases over the ensuing several decades. The next distinct era came with the discovery of processes to produce monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and development of more specific therapies. Interestingly, mAb technology resulted in many products to treat autoimmune and allergic diseases, but only one common infectious disease, respiratory syncytial virus, and only in a restricted population of high-risk infants.The current era began in 2003 with a series of publications demonstrating processes for rapidly producing human mAbs.This technology combined with new sequencing technology, advances in structural biology, atomic-level molecular design, and increased capacity for synthetic biology, promises new opportunities to apply passive immunization to the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.",

This study was conducted to reveal new knowledge about how GPs think in relation to the prescribing of antibiotics - knowledge that could be used in efforts toward rational treatment of infectious diseases in primary care. The aim was to explore and describe the variations in GPs' perceptions of infectious disease management, with special reference to antibiotic prescribing. Twenty GPs working at primary care centres in a county in south-west Sweden were purposively selected based on the strategy of including GPs with different kinds of experience. The GPs were interviewed and perceptions among GPs were analysed by a phenomenographic approach. Five qualitatively different perceptions of infectious disease management were identified. They were: (A) the GP must help the patient to achieve health and well-being; (B) the management must meet the GP's perceived personal, professional and organisational demands; (C) restrictive antibiotic prescribing is time-consuming; (D) restrictive antibiotic prescribing can protect the effectiveness of antibiotics; and (E) patients benefit personally from restrictive antibiotic prescribing. Restrictive antibiotic prescribing was considered important in two perceptions, was not an issue as such in two others, and was considered in one perception although the actual prescribing was greatly influenced by the interaction between patient and GP. Accordingly, to encourage restrictive antibiotic prescribing several aspects must be addressed. Furthermore, different GPs need various kinds of support. Infectious disease management in primary care is complex and time-consuming, which must be acknowledged in healthcare organisation and planning.",

In this prospective study, clinical CMV disease was diagnosed in 26 of 68 patients (38%) that received transplants between 1974 and 1976 on the basis of viral isolation and/or >4-fold rise in complement-fixing antibody in patients with an unexplained febrile illness of >5 days' duration. All CMV syndromes began 1 to 4 months post-transplant, persisting up to 23 weeks thereafter (mean duration of symptoms was 19 days). Although CMV was observed in some instances to cause only prolonged fever (10 patients) or hepatitis (4 patients), its most important effects were pneumonia (9 patients) and profound leukopenia (8 patients). Three patterns of pneumonia were observed: bilateral interstitial pneumonia (3 patients), unilateral focal consolidation (1 patient) (both attributable to CMV alone), and diffuse bilateral pneumonia attributable to CMV and superinfecting microorganisms (5 patients). These last patients had CMV-induced leukopenia of >1 week's duration at onset of superinfection, and all died. The 4 patients without leukopenia did not develop superinfection, and all survived. Two other renal transplant recipients died of infection during this period, both with CMV, leukopenia, and Listeria monocytogenes sepsis. The major infectious disease importance of CMV appears to be its effects on the respiratory tract and systemic host defense in predisposing to fatal superinfection.",

    "abstract_text": "Serum IgG1 concentrations of calves less than 3 weeks old and dying from infectious disease were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) than those of clinically normal calves. Fifty percent of the dead calves had serum IgG1 concentrations that were more than 2 standard deviations below the normal mean, and an additional 35% had IgG1 concentrations that were more than 1 standard deviation below the normal mean. Low IgG1 concentrations were attributed to failures in passive transfer of colostral immunoglobulin. The few calves dying of noninfectious causes generally had normal serum immunoglobulin concentrations. The results of this study emphasize the importance of adequate colostral intake and absorption to the neonatal calf. In view of the large numbers of calves that die from neonatal infection each year, it may be assumed that failure in passive transfer, as reflected by low serum immunoglobulin concentrations, is one of the most important factors influencing neonatal calf mortality.",

Our ability to quantify and predict how this heterogeneity impacts risks of infection and disease emergence is the key to successful disease prevention efforts. Here, we review the literature on infectious diseases from human, agricultural, and wildlife ecosystems to describe the rapid ecological and evolutionary responses in pathogens to environmental heterogeneity, with expected impacts on their epidemiology. To date, the underlying network structures through which disease transmission proceeds have been notoriously difficult to quantify because of this variation. We show that with recent advances in statistical methods and genomic approaches, it is now more feasible than ever to trace disease transmission networks, the molecular underpinning of infection, and the environmental variation relevant to disease dynamics. We end by identifying major new opportunities and challenges in understanding disease dynamics in an ever-changing world.",

    "abstract_text": "Despite growing awareness of the importance of controlling neglected tropical diseases as a contribution to poverty alleviation and achieving the Millennium Development Goals, there is a need to up-scale programmes to achieve wider public health benefits. This implementation deficit is attributable to several factors but one often overlooked is the specific difficulty in tackling diseases that involve both people and animals - the zoonoses. A Disease Reference Group on Zoonoses and Marginalised Infectious Diseases (DRG6) was convened by the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), a programme executed by the World Health Organization and co-sponsored by UNICEF, UNDP, the World Bank and WHO. The key considerations included: (a) the general lack of reliable quantitative data on their public health burden; (b) the need to evaluate livestock production losses and their additional impacts on health and poverty; (c) the relevance of cross-sectoral issues essential to designing and implementing public health interventions for zoonotic diseases; and (d) identifying priority areas for research and interventions to harness resources most effectively. Beyond disease specific research issues, a set of common macro-priorities and interventions were identified which, if implemented through a more integrated approach by countries, would have a significant impact on human health of the most marginalised populations characteristically dependent on livestock.",

The prevalence of the following risk factors (RF) of cardiovascular diseases is evaluated: high blood pressure \u2014 33,8%, obesity \u2014 29,7%, high total cholesterol \u2014 57,6%, high glucose level or diabetes \u2014 4,6%, smoking (tobacco consumption) \u2014 25,7%, insufficient (low) level of physical activity \u2014 38,8%, excessive salt consumption \u2014 49,9% and insufficient vegetables and fruits consumption \u2014 41,9%. Gender differences and an increase with the age of the parameters mentioned are described. The absence of a epidemiologic monitoring system at the Federal level leads to an impossibility of clear conclusions on the RF dynamics in Russian population. While comparing the ECVD-RF study with previous epidemiological studies we can just cautiously suppose the existence in 21st age of negative dynamics of one RF (obesity, dyslipidemia) and positive dynamics of the others (smoking).",

    "abstract_text": "Background Empirical social contact patterns are essential to understand the spread of infectious diseases. To date, no such data existed for France. Although infectious diseases are frequently seasonal, the temporal variation of contact patterns has not been documented hitherto. Methods COMES-F is the first French large-scale population survey, carried out over 3 different periods (February-March, April, April-May) with some participants common to the first and the last period. Participants described their contacts for 2 consecutive days, and reported separately on professional contacts when typically over 20 per day. Results 2033 participants reported 38 881 contacts (weighted median [first quartile-third quartile]: 8[5\u201314] per day), and 54 378 contacts with supplementary professional contacts (9[5\u201317]). Contrary to age, gender, household size, holidays, weekend and occupation, period of the year had little influence on the number of contacts or the mixing patterns. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age, irrespective of the location of the contact, and gender, with women having 8% more contacts than men. Although most contacts occurred at home and at school, the inclusion of professional contacts modified the structure of the mixing patterns. Holidays and weekends reduced dramatically the number of contacts, and as proxies for school closure, reduced R0 by 33% and 28%, respectively. Thus, school closures could have an important impact on the spread of close contact infections in France. Conclusions Despite no clear evidence for temporal variation, trends suggest that more studies are needed. Age and gender were found important determinants of the mixing patterns. Gender differences in mixing patterns might help explain gender differences in the epidemiology of infectious diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "The parasite paradox arises from the dual observations that parasites (broadly construed, including phy- tophagous insects) are resource specialists with restricted host ranges, and yet shifts onto relatively unrelated hosts are common in the phylogenetic diversification of parasite lineages and directly observable in ecological time. We synthe- size the emerging solution to this paradox: phenotypic flexibility and phylogenetic conservatism in traits related to resource use, grouped under the term ecological fitting, provide substantial opportunities for rapid host switching in changing environments, in the absence of the evolution of novel host-utilization capabilities. We discuss mechanisms behind ecological fitting, its implications for defining specialists and generalists, and briefly review empirical examples of host shifts in the context of ecological fitting. We conclude that host shifts via ecological fitting provide the fuel for the expansion phase of the recently proposed oscillation hypothesis of host range and speciation, and, more generally, the generation of novel combinations of interacting species within the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution. Finally, we conclude that taxon pulses, driven by climate change and large-scale ecological perturbation are drivers of biotic mixing and resultant ecological fitting, which leads to increased rates of rapid host switching, including the agents of Emerging Infectious Disease.",

    "abstract_text": "Despite the overwhelming success of vaccines in preventing infectious diseases, there remain numerous globally devastating diseases without fully protective vaccines, particularly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria and tuberculosis. Nanotechnology approaches are being developed both to design new vaccines against these diseases as well as to facilitate their global implementation. The reasons why a given pathogen may present difficulties for vaccine design are unique and tied to the co-evolutionary history of the pathogen and humans, but there are common challenges that nanotechnology is beginning to help address. In each case, a successful vaccine will need to raise immune responses that differ from the immune responses raised by normal infection. Nanomaterials, with their defined compositions, commonly modular construction, and length scales allowing the engagement of key immune pathways, collectively facilitate the iterative design process necessary to identify such protective immune responses and achieve them reliably. Nanomaterials also provide strategies for engineering the trafficking and delivery of vaccine components to key immune cells and lymphoid tissues, and they can be highly multivalent, improving their engagement with the immune system. This Review will discuss these aspects along with recent nanomaterial advances towards vaccines against infectious disease, with a particular emphasis on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Several globally significant infectious diseases are not yet treatable with vaccination; nanomaterials are being investigated to provide new strategies for vaccine development.",

To control the outbreak of mucosal infectious diseases, we must use our knowledge of the mucosal immune system to create vaccines that elicit protective mucosal and systemic immunity. Mucosal vaccines have advantages over traditional injectable vaccines in that they not only induce effective mucosal immune responses, but they also do not cause physical or psychological discomfort. Mucosal vaccines currently licensed for human use include oral vaccines against Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, poliovirus and rotavirus, and nasal vaccines against influenza virus. To further improve the existing vaccines, it will be necessary to develop novel vaccine production, storage and delivery systems through innovative strategies derived from interdisciplinary scientific research. Our accumulated knowledge of the innate and acquired arms of the mucosal immune system and the recent scientific and technical advancements in the fields of molecular biology, plant biology, bio-engineering and chemical engineering, genome biology and systems biology have created a unique research and development platform for the development of the next generation of mucosal vaccines. This review summarizes the current perspectives and future directions of mucosal vaccine development with emphasis on oral and nasal vaccines for the control of infectious diseases.",

Upon activation, TREM-1 can directly amplify an inflammatory response. Although it was initially demonstrated that TREM-1 was predominantly associated with infectious diseases, recent evidences shed new light into its role in sterile inflammatory diseases. Indeed, TREM-1 receptor and its signaling pathways contribute to the pathology of several non-infectious acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis, ischemia reperfusion-induced tissue injury, colitis, fibrosis and cancer. This review, aims to give an extensive overview of TREM-1 in non-infectious diseases, with the focus on the therapeutic potential of TREM-1 intervention strategies herein. In addition, we provide the reader with a functional enrichment analysis of TREM-1 signaling pathway and potential TREM-1 ligands in these diseases, obtained via in silico approach. We discuss pre-clinical studies which show that TREM-1 inhibition, via synthetic soluble TREM-1 protein mimickers, is effective in treating (preventing) specific inflammatory disorders, without significant effects on antibacterial response. Further research aimed at identifying specific TREM-1 ligands, in different inflammatory disorders, is required to further unravel the role of this receptor, and explore new avenues to modulate its function.",

A substantial proportion of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) do not have traditional risk factors. Infectious diseases may play a role in these cases, or they may intensify the effect of other risk factors. The association of CAD and Chlamydia pneumoniae infection is firmly established, but causality is yet to be proven. The link with other infectious agents or conditions, such as cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, Helicobacter pylori and periodontitis, is more controversial. Cytomegalovirus infection is more strongly linked than native CAD to coronary artery restenosis after angioplasty and to accelerated CAD after cardiac transplantation. However, new data on this topic are appearing in the literature almost every month. The potential for novel therapeutic management of cardiovascular disease and stroke is great if infection is proven to cause or accelerate CAD or atherosclerosis. However, physicians should not \"jump the gun\" and start using antibiotic therapy prematurely for CAD. The results of large randomized clinical trials in progress will help establish causality and the benefits of antimicrobial therapy in CAD.",

This fourth edition of the guidelines, made available on the Internet in 2001, is intended for clinicians and other health-care providers who care for HIV-infected persons. The goal of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based guidelines for preventing OIs among HIV-infected adults and adolescents, including pregnant women, and HIV-exposed or infected children. Nineteen OIs, or groups of OIs, are addressed, and recommendations are included for preventing exposure to opportunistic pathogens, preventing first episodes of disease by chemoprophylaxis or vaccination (primary prophylaxis), and preventing disease recurrence (secondary prophylaxis). Major changes since the last edition of the guidelines include 1) updated recommendations for discontinuing primary and secondary OI prophylaxis among persons whose CD4+ T lymphocyte counts have increased in response to antiretroviral therapy; 2) emphasis on screening all HIV-infected persons for infection with hepatitis C virus; 3) new information regarding transmission of human herpesvirus 8 infection; 4) new information regarding drug interactions, chiefly related to rifamycins and antiretroviral drugs; and 5) revised recommendations for immunizing HIV-infected adults and adolescents and HIV-exposed or infected children.",

    "title": "Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the Negative Binomial Dispersion Parameter for Highly Overdispersed Data, with Applications to Infectious Diseases",
    "abstract_text": "Background The negative binomial distribution is used commonly throughout biology as a model for overdispersed count data, with attention focused on the negative binomial dispersion parameter, k. A substantial literature exists on the estimation of k, but most attention has focused on datasets that are not highly overdispersed (i.e., those with k\u22651), and the accuracy of confidence intervals estimated for k is typically not explored. Methodology This article presents a simulation study exploring the bias, precision, and confidence interval coverage of maximum-likelihood estimates of k from highly overdispersed distributions. In addition to exploring small-sample bias on negative binomial estimates, the study addresses estimation from datasets influenced by two types of event under-counting, and from disease transmission data subject to selection bias for successful outbreaks. Conclusions Results show that maximum likelihood estimates of k can be biased upward by small sample size or under-reporting of zero-class events, but are not biased downward by any of the factors considered. Confidence intervals estimated from the asymptotic sampling variance tend to exhibit coverage below the nominal level, with overestimates of k comprising the great majority of coverage errors. Estimation from outbreak datasets does not increase the bias of k estimates, but can add significant upward bias to estimates of the mean. Because k varies inversely with the degree of overdispersion, these findings show that overestimation of the degree of overdispersion is very rare for these datasets.",

    "abstract_text": "Iron deficiency anemia is thought to affect the health of more than one billion people worldwide, with the greatest burden of disease experienced in lesser developed countries, particularly women of reproductive age and children. This greater disease burden is due to both nutritional and infectious etiologies. Individuals in lesser developed countries have diets that are much lower in iron, less access to multivitamins for young children and pregnant women, and increased rates of fertility which increase demands for iron through the life course. Infectious diseases, particularly parasitic diseases, also lead to both extracorporeal iron loss and anemia of inflammation, which decreases bioavailability of iron to host tissues. This paper will address the unique etiologies and consequences of both iron deficiency anemia and the alterations in iron absorption and distribution seen in the context of anemia of inflammation. Implications for diagnosis and treatment in this unique context will also be discussed.",

The tolerance of catheter-associated biofilm organisms toward systemic antimicrobial treatments and the potential for development of antimicrobial resistance in the health care environment underscores the importance of alternative treatment strategies. Biofilms are microbial communities that exhibit unique characteristics that must be considered when evaluating the potential of biofilm prevention or control strategies. Because biofilm-associated infections do not respond consistently to therapeutically achievable concentrations of many antimicrobial agents, treatments that are more effective against slowly growing biofilm cells or combination treatments that can penetrate the biofilm matrix may be more effective. Alternative strategies that do not incorporate antimicrobial drugs have also been investigated. These approaches have the potential to prevent or eradicate biofilms on indwelling intravascular catheters and prevent or resolve catheter-related infections.",

    "abstract_text": "The incidence of extreme precipitation has increased with the exacerbation of worldwide climate disruption. We hypothesize an association between precipitation and the distribution patterns that would affect the endemic burden of 8 infectious diseases in Taiwan, including water- and vector-borne infectious diseases. A database integrating daily precipitation and temperature, along with the infectious disease case registry for all 352 townships in the main island of Taiwan was analysed for the period from 1994 to 2008. Four precipitation levels, <130 mm, 130\u2013200 mm, 200\u2013350 mm and >350 mm, were categorized to represent quantitative differences, and their associations with each specific disease was investigated using the Generalized Additive Mixed Model and afterwards mapped on to the Geographical Information System. Daily precipitation levels were significantly correlated with all 8 mandatory-notified infectious diseases in Taiwan. For water-borne infections, extreme torrential precipitation (>350 mm/day) was found to result in the highest relative risk for bacillary dysentery and enterovirus infections when compared to ordinary rain (<130 mm/day). Yet, for vector-borne diseases, the relative risk of dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis increased with greater precipitation only up to 350 mm. Differential lag effects following precipitation were statistically associated with increased risk for contracting individual infectious diseases. This study's findings can help health resource sector management better allocate medical resources and be better prepared to deal with infectious disease outbreaks following future extreme precipitation events.",

The central finding is that heterogeneity in contact networks, such as the presence of 'superspreaders', accelerates infectious disease spread in real epidemics. Disease control is also complicated by the continuous evolution of pathogens in response to changing environments and medical interventions. It remains unclear, however, how population structure influences these adaptive processes. Here we examine the evolution of infectious disease in empirical and theoretical networks. We show that the heterogeneity in contact structure, which facilitates the spread of a single disease, surprisingly renders a resident strain more resilient to invasion by new variants. Our results suggest that many host contact structures suppress invasion of new strains and may slow disease adaptation. These findings are important to the natural history of disease evolution and the spread of drug-resistant strains.",

We defined four levels of putative at-risk events from casual (physical contact without conversation) to intimate (contact of a sexual nature), and asked university student volunteers to record details on those they contacted at these levels on three separate days. We found that intimate contacts are stable over short time periods whereas there was no evidence of repeat casual contacts with the same individuals. The contacts were increasingly assortative as intimacy increased. Such information will aid the development and parameterisation of models of close contact diseases, and may have direct use in outbreak investigations.",

We test the approach by applying it to temporal, geographical and genetic data on the 241 poultry farms infected in an epidemic of avian influenza A (H7N7) in The Netherlands in 2003. We show that the combined approach estimates the transmission tree with higher correctness and resolution than analyses based on genetic or epidemiological data alone.

    "abstract_text": "A polymorphism in the promoter of human NRAMP1 encodes a Z-DNA forming dinucleotide repeat with four alleles: (1) t(gt)5ac(gt)5ac(gt)11g; (2) t(gt)5ac(gt)5 ac(gt)10g; (3) t(gt)5ac(gt) ac(gt)9g; and (4) t(gt)5ac(gt)9g. Alleles 1 and 4 are rare (gene frequencies approximately 0.001); alleles 2 and 3 occur at gene frequencies approximately 0.20-0.25 and approximately 0.75-0.80, respectively. Here, luciferase reporter gene constructs are used to show that the four alleles differ in their ability to drive gene expression. In the absence of exogenous stimuli, alleles 1, 2, and 4 are poor promoters; allele 3 drives high expression, indicating that the repeat itself has endogenous enhancer activity. All four alleles show a similar percentage enhancement of reporter gene expression in the presence of interferon-gamma, consistent with the multiple interferon-gamma response elements both 5' and 3' of the Z-DNA forming repeat. However, while the addition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has no effect on alleles 1 and 4, it causes significant reduction in expression driven by allele 2 and enhances expression driven by allele 3, suggesting that the juxtaposition of LPS related response elements (NFkappaB, AP-1, NF-IL6) may be differentially affected by the two commonly occurring alleles. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic hyperactivation of macrophages associated with allele 3 is functionally linked to autoimmune disease susceptibility, while the poor level of NRAMP1 expression promoted by allele 2 contributes to infectious disease susceptibility. Conversely, allele 3 protects against infectious disease and allele 2 against autoimmune disease. Hence, alleles that are detrimental in relation to autoimmune disease susceptibility may be maintained in the population because they improve survival to reproductive age following infectious disease challenge.",

However, the distribution of A. cantonensis and its intermediate host snails, and the role of two invasive snail species in the emergence of angiostrongyliasis, are not well understood. Methodology/Principal Findings A national survey pertaining to A. cantonensis was carried out using a grid sampling approach (spatial resolution: 40\u00d740 km). One village per grid cell was randomly selected from a 5% random sample of grid cells located in areas where the presence of the intermediate host snail Pomacea canaliculata had been predicted based on a degree-day model. Potential intermediate hosts of A. cantonensis were collected in the field, restaurants, markets and snail farms, and examined for infection. The infection prevalence among intermediate host snails was estimated, and the prevalence of A. cantonensis within P. canaliculata was displayed on a map, and predicted for non-sampled locations. It was confirmed that P. canaliculata and Achatina fulica were the predominant intermediate hosts of A. cantonensis in China, and these snails were found to be well established in 11 and six provinces, respectively. Infected snails of either species were found in seven provinces, closely matching the endemic area of A. cantonensis. Infected snails were also found in markets and restaurants. Two clusters of A. cantonensis\u2013infected P. canaliculata were predicted in Fujian and Guangxi provinces. Conclusions/Significance The first national survey in China revealed a wide distribution of A. cantonensis and two invasive snail species, indicating that a considerable number of people are at risk of angiostrongyliasis. Health education, rigorous food inspection and surveillance are all needed to prevent recurrent angiostrongyliasis outbreaks.",

METHODS: Through the population-based All Infants in Southeast Sweden study, parents recorded data on feeding and infectious disease prospectively. Complete data on gluten introduction and breastfeeding duration were available for 9408 children. Those children had 42 826 parent-reported episodes of infectious disease in the first year of life (including 4003 episodes of gastroenteritis). We identified 44 children with biopsy-verified CD diagnosed after 1 year of age, and we used Cox regression to estimate the risk of future CD for children with infection at gluten introduction. RESULTS: Eighteen children with CD (40.9%) had an infection at the time of gluten introduction, compared with 2510 reference individuals (26.8%; P = .035). Few children had gastroenteritis at the time of gluten introduction (1 child with CD [2.3%] vs 166 reference individuals [1.8%]; P = .546). With adjustment for age at gluten introduction and breastfeeding duration, we found no association between a future diagnosis of CD and either any infection (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.8 [95% confidence interval: 0.9\u20133.6]) or gastroenteritis (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.6 [95% confidence interval: 0.2\u201330.8]) at the time of gluten introduction. We found no associations between breastfeeding duration, age at gluten introduction, and future CD. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that parent-reported infection at the time of gluten introduction is not a major risk factor for CD.",

    "abstract_text": "Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV) is characterised by chronic or recurrent infectious mononucleosis-like symptoms, such as fever, hepatosplenomegaly, persistent hepatitis and extensive lymphadenopathy. Patients with CAEBV have high viral loads in their peripheral blood and/or an unusual pattern of EBV-related antibodies. This disease is rare but severe with high morbidity and mortality. Nearly three decades have passed since this disease was first identified, and recent advances in technology have increased our understanding of CAEBV pathophysiology. There is accumulating evidence that the clonal expansion of EBV-infected T or natural killer (NK) cells plays a central role in the pathogenesis of CAEBV. However, it remains unclear whether CAEBV is truly a monoclonal lymphoproliferative disorder. EBV-infected T or NK cells are able to evade the host cellular immune system due to the limited expression of viral proteins of reduced antigenicity. Recent studies suggest that infection of T or NK cells is a common event during primary EBV infection. A defect or single nucleotide polymorphism in host immune-modulating genes may allow for the expansion of virus infected cells giving rise to CAEBV. In this review, I summarise our current understanding of the pathogenesis of CAEBV and propose a model of CAEBV pathogenicity. Copyright \u00a9 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract_text": "The disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has caused dramatic amphibian population declines and extinctions in Australia, Central and North America, and Europe. Bd is associated with >200 species extinctions of amphibians, but not all species that become infected are susceptible to the disease. Specifically, Bd has rapidly emerged in some areas of the world, such as in Australia, USA, and throughout Central and South America, causing population and species collapse. The mechanism behind the rapid global emergence of the disease is poorly understood, in part due to an incomplete picture of the global distribution of Bd. At present, there is a considerable amount of geographic bias in survey effort for Bd, with Asia being the most neglected continent. To date, Bd surveys have been published for few Asian countries, and infected amphibians have been reported only from Indonesia, South Korea, China and Japan. Thus far, there have been no substantiated reports of enigmatic or suspected disease-caused population declines of the kind that has been attributed to Bd in other areas. In order to gain a more detailed picture of the distribution of Bd in Asia, we undertook a widespread, opportunistic survey of over 3,000 amphibians for Bd throughout Asia and adjoining Papua New Guinea. Survey sites spanned 15 countries, approximately 36\u00b0 latitude, 111\u00b0 longitude, and over 2000 m in elevation. Bd prevalence was very low throughout our survey area (2.35% overall) and infected animals were not clumped as would be expected in epizootic events. This suggests that Bd is either newly emerging in Asia, endemic at low prevalence, or that some other ecological factor is preventing Bd from fully invading Asian amphibians. The current observed pattern in Asia differs from that in many other parts of the world.",

The environments in which these athletes compete, practice, receive therapy for injuries, and travel, both domestically and internationally, provide varied opportunities for the transmission of infectious organisms. The purpose of this medical literature review is to identify the agents most commonly reported in the medical literature as responsible for infectious disease outbreaks in specific sports and their modes of transmission and to guide targeted prevention efforts. A literature review of English-language articles in medical publications that reported outbreaks of infectious diseases in competitive athletes was conducted in PubMed MEDLINE from 1966 through May 2005. Outbreaks that were solely food borne were excluded. Fifty-nine reports of infectious disease outbreaks in competitive sports were identified in the published medical literature. Herpes simplex virus infections appear to be common among wrestlers and rugby players, with no single strain responsible for the outbreaks. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was responsible for several recent outbreaks of soft tissue and skin infections among collegiate and professional athletes. The most common mode of transmission in outbreaks was direct, person-to-person (primarily skin-to-skin) contact. Blood-borne exposure was implicated in 2 confirmed outbreaks of hepatitis. Airborne and vector transmissions were rarely reported. This review provides an overview of infectious disease outbreaks thought to be either serious enough or unusual enough to report. Appropriate surveillance of the frequency of infections will allow sports medicine staff to identify outbreaks quickly and take necessary measures to contain further transmission and prevent future outbreaks.",

    "abstract_text": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the best-studied family of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), whose task is to rapidly recognize evolutionarily conserved structures on the invading microorganisms. Through binding to these patterns, TLRs trigger a number of proinflammatory and anti-microbial responses, playing a key role in the first line of defence against the pathogens also promoting adaptive immunity responses. Growing amounts of data suggest that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the various human TLR proteins are associated with altered susceptibility to infection. This review summarizes the role of TLRs in innate immunity, their ligands and signalling and focuses on the TLR SNPs which have been linked to infectious disease susceptibility.",

Adherence with prenatal screening recommendations was evaluated for hepatitis B, syphilis, rubella, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and group B streptococcus (GBS). Characteristics of missed opportunities for disease prevention were assessed by univariate and multivariable analysis to account for survey design.Prenatal screening rates for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (96.5%), syphilis (98.2%), and rubella (97.3%) were high. Areas of excess syphilis morbidity did not adhere to recommendations for third-trimester retesting. Testing rates for HIV (57.2%) and GBS (52.0%) were lower and had wide geographic variation. Postpartum rubella vaccination was documented for only 65.7% of rubella-susceptible women. Inadequate prenatal care was the single strongest predictor of missed opportunities for prenatal testing (relative risk 14.6; 95% confidence interval 6.3, 33.7). Blacks were less likely than whites to receive adequate prenatal care and prenatal tests, more likely to test positive for HBsAg and syphilis, and less likely to receive recommended prevention interventions such as postpartum rubella vaccination for susceptible women.Adherence to both long-standing and more recent recommendations for congenital and perinatal disease prevention can be improved, thus perhaps reducing racial disparities in the use of prenatal screening and appropriate prevention interventions.",

This study determined quantitatively the risk of diarrhoeal illness and upper respiratory infection (URI) among day\u2010care children in comparison with home\u2010care children. It examined the extent of risks in day\u2010care children under different conditions of three age groups, enrolled in two health plans, and from families of two levels of education. Methods The study subjects were recruited through two health plans: a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) and the Medicaid program in Columbia, South Carolina of the USA. The sample was collected using a household survey of children, aged 5 years or younger. The participants were contacted bimonthly for 18 months with 435 attending out\u2010of\u2010home day care facilities and 753 being cared for at home. The potential confounding factors of family characteristics were controlled in examining the odds ratios for day care effect on common infections in children under different conditions. Results In general, risks of diarrhoeal illness and URI in day\u2010care children are greater than in home\u2010care children. Children younger than 1.5 years of age attending day care and covered by the Medicaid program are at the greatest risk. The difference in risks between day\u2010care and home\u2010care children, however, is reduced to an insignificant level for children older than 1.5 years of age and for children covered by the HMO health plan. Among day\u2010care children, those who are covered by the Medicaid program are at a significantly higher risk than those who are covered by the HMO health plan. Conclusions Although day\u2010care children in general suffer a greater risk of common infectious diseases, the extent of day care effect on risks of diarrhoeal illness and URI varies significantly by age and type of health insurance plan.",

    "abstract_text": "This report updates and combines into one document earlier versions of guidelines for preventing and treating opportunistic infections (OIs) among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children, last published in 2002 and 2004, respectively. These guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and other health-care workers providing medical care for HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children in the United States. The guidelines discuss opportunistic pathogens that occur in the United States and one that might be acquired during international travel (i.e., malaria). Topic areas covered for each OI include a brief description of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of the OI in children; prevention of exposure; prevention of disease by chemoprophylaxis and/or vaccination; discontinuation of primary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution; treatment of disease; monitoring for adverse effects during treatment; management of treatment failure; prevention of disease recurrence; and discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution. A separate document about preventing and treating of OIs among HIV-infected adults and postpubertal adolescents (Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents) was prepared by a working group of adult HIV and infectious disease specialists. The guidelines were developed by a panel of specialists in pediatric HIV infection and infectious diseases (the Pediatric Opportunistic Infections Working Group) from the U.S. government and academic institutions. For each OI, a pediatric specialist with content-matter expertise reviewed the literature for new information since the last guidelines were published; they then proposed revised recommendations at a meeting at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in June 2007. After these presentations and discussions, the guidelines underwent further revision, with review and approval by the Working Group, and final endorsement by NIH, CDC, the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society (PIDS), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The recommendations are rated by a letter that indicates the strength of the recommendation and a Roman numeral that indicates the quality of the evidence supporting the recommendation so readers can ascertain how best to apply the recommendations in their practice environments. An important mode of acquisition of OIs, as well as HIV infection among children, is from their infected mother; HIV-infected women coinfected with opportunistic pathogens might be more likely than women without HIV infection to transmit these infections to their infants. In addition, HIV-infected women or HIV-infected family members coinfected with certain opportunistic pathogens might be more likely to transmit these infections horizontally to their children, resulting in increased likelihood of primary acquisition of such infections in the young child. Therefore, infections with opportunistic pathogens might affect not just HIV-infected infants but also HIV-exposed but uninfected infants who become infected by the pathogen because of transmission from HIV-infected mothers or family members with coinfections. These guidelines for treating OIs in children therefore consider treatment of infections among all children, both HIV-infected and uninfected, born to HIV-infected women. Additionally, HIV infection is increasingly seen among adolescents with perinatal infection now surviving into their teens and among youth with behaviorally acquired HIV infection. Although guidelines for postpubertal adolescents can be found in the adult OI guidelines, drug pharmacokinetics and response to treatment may differ for younger prepubertal or pubertal adolescents. Therefore, these guidelines also apply to treatment of HIV-infected youth who have not yet completed pubertal development. Major changes in the guidelines include 1) greater emphasis on the importance of antiretroviral therapy for preventing and treating OIs, especially those OIs for which no specific therapy exists; 2) information about the diagnosis and management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes; 3) information about managing antiretroviral therapy in children with OIs, including potential drug--drug interactions; 4) new guidance on diagnosing of HIV infection and presumptively excluding HIV infection in infants that affect the need for initiation of prophylaxis to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in neonates; 5) updated immunization recommendations for HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children, including hepatitis A, human papillomavirus, meningococcal, and rotavirus vaccines; 6) addition of sections on aspergillosis; bartonella; human herpes virus-6, -7, and -8; malaria; and progressive multifocal leukodystrophy (PML); and 7) new recommendations on discontinuation of OI prophylaxis after immune reconstitution in children. The report includes six tables pertinent to preventing and treating OIs in children and two figures describing immunization recommendations for children aged 0--6 years and 7--18 years. Because treatment of OIs is an evolving science, and availability of new agents or clinical data on existing agents might change therapeutic options and preferences, these recommendations will be periodically updated and will be available at http://AIDSInfo.nih.gov.",

These include what factors commonly facilitate transmission of pathogens to novel host species, what drives variation in immune investment among host species, and more generally what drives global patterns of parasite diversity and distribution? Here we consider how the perspectives and tools of macroecology, a field that investigates patterns and processes at broad spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales, are expanding scientific understanding of global infectious disease ecology. In particular, emerging approaches are providing new insights about scaling properties across all living taxa, and new strategies for mapping pathogen biodiversity and infection risk. Ultimately, macroecology is establishing a framework to more accurately predict global patterns of infectious disease distribution and emergence.",

However, the quality of supporting literature can vary greatly.We analyzed the strength of recommendation and overall quality of evidence behind 41 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines released between January 1994 and May 2010. Individual recommendations were classified based on their strength of recommendation (levels A through C) and quality of evidence (levels I through III). Guidelines not following this format were excluded from further analysis. Evolution of IDSA guidelines was assessed by comparing 5 recently updated guidelines with their earlier versions.In the 41 analyzed guidelines, 4218 individual recommendations were found and tabulated. Fourteen percent of the recommendations were classified as level I, 31% as level II, and 55% as level III evidence. Among class A recommendations (good evidence for support), 23% were level I (\u22651 randomized controlled trial) and 37% were based on expert opinion only (level III). Updated guidelines expanded the absolute number of individual recommendations substantially. However, few were due to a sizable increase in level I evidence; most additional recommendations had level II and III evidence.More than half of the current recommendations of the IDSA are based on level III evidence only. Until more data from well-designed controlled clinical trials become available, physicians should remain cautious when using current guidelines as the sole source guiding patient care decisions.",

Ongoing surveillance of this unique population is needed to detect changing epidemiology and provide appropriate care. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 504 children adopted from abroad and evaluated from 1997 to 1998 to determine the prevalence of and factors associated with various infectious diseases. Results. The mean age of the study participants at medical evaluation was 1.6 years; 71% were girls, and they were adopted from 16 countries, including China (48%), Russia (31%), Southeast Asia (8%), Eastern Europe (8%), and Latin America (5%). Overall, 75 (19%) of 404 children tested had tuberculin skin tests \u226510 mm, but all had normal chest radiographs. BCG vaccination (odds ratio [OR]: 7.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.29, 17.16) and being Russian born (OR: 2.90; 95% CI: 1.68, 5.00) were risk factors for latent tuberculosis infection. Fourteen (2.8%) children had detectable hepatitis B surface antigen, but no child had active hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, or syphilis. Giardia lambliaantigen was detected in 87 (19%) of 461 tested children, and such children were older (mean: 22 months vs 15.5 months) and more likely to have been born in Eastern Europe (OR: 2.82; 95% CI: 1.70, 4.68). Conclusions. We demonstrated increased rates of latent tuberculosis infection and G lamblia infection than previously reported. Thus, ongoing surveillance of internationally adopted children, international trends in infectious diseases, and appropriate screening will ensure the long-term health of adopted children as well as their families.",

The Institute of Medicine emphasized that data on sexually transmitted infections, Pap smear screening, and cervical dysplasia among lesbians were needed to guide clinical practice, policy development, and patient education. Use of surveillance data for this purpose is limited because risk classifications exclude same-gender sex among women or subsume it under behaviors considered as higher risk. However, sexual transmission of human papillomavirus, HIV, Treponema pallidum, and Trichomonas vaginalis between women has been reported. Data indicate that lesbians receive routine Pap smear screening less frequently than is optimal. Moreover, lesbians commonly report previous pregnancy, induced abortion, and hormonal contraceptive use. Education of lesbians and their care providers should counter assumptions that sex between women confers no risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections, and lesbians should receive Pap smears according to current guidelines.",

Objectives To investigate antibiotic prescribing practices in patients with COVID-19. Methods We performed an international web-based survey and investigated the pattern of antibiotic use as reported by physicians involved in treatment of COVID-19. SPSS Statistics version 25 was used for data analysis. Results The survey was completed by 166 participants from 23 countries and 82 different hospitals. Local guidelines for antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients were reported by 61.8% (n = 102) of participants and for 82.9% (n = 136) they did not differ from local community-acquired pneumonia guidelines. Clinical presentation was recognized as the most important reason for the start of antibiotics (mean score = 4.07 and SD = 1.095 on grading scale from 1 to 5). When antibiotics were started, most respondents rated as the highest the need for coverage of atypical pathogens (mean score = 2.8 and SD = 0.99), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (mean score = 2.67 and SD = 1.05 on bi-modal scale, with values 1 and 2 for disagreement and values 3 and 4 for agreement). In the patients on the ward, 29.1% of respondents chose not to prescribe any antibiotic. Combination of \u03b2-lactams and macrolides or fluoroquinolones was reported by 52.4% (n = 87) of respondents. In patients in the ICU, piperacillin/tazobactam was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic. The mean reported duration of antibiotic treatment was 7.12 (SD = 2.44) days. Conclusions The study revealed widespread broad-spectrum antibiotic use in patients with COVID-19. Implementation of antimicrobial stewardship principles is warranted to mitigate the negative consequences of antibiotic therapy.",

    "abstract_text": "Public health officials once suggested that it might someday be possible to \"close the book\" on the study and treatment of infectious diseases. However, it is now clear that endemic diseases as well as newly emerging ones (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]), reemerging ones (e.g., West Nile virus), and even deliberately disseminated infectious diseases (e.g., anthrax from bioterrorism) continue to pose a substantial threat throughout the world. Over the past several decades, the global effort to identify and characterize infectious agents, decipher the underlying pathways by which they cause disease, and develop preventive measures and treatments for many of the world's most dangerous pathogens has helped control many endemic diseases. But despite considerable progress, infectious diseases continue to present significant challenges as new microbial threats emerge and reemerge. HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, SARS, West Nile virus, Marburg virus, and bioterrorism are examples of some of the emerging and reemerging threats. In responding to these ongoing challenges, a new paradigm in countermeasure development is needed. In the past, U.S. government-sponsored biomedical researchers have focused on basic research and concept development, leaving product development to the pharmaceutical industry. Increasingly, however, the government has become involved in more targeted countermeasure development efforts. In this regard, partnerships between government, industry, and academia are necessary as we struggle to maintain and update our armamentarium in the struggle to outwit the microbes that pose a never-ending threat to mankind.",

This pattern is not unique to EID but extends to many risks, making EID fruitful events for understanding public apprehension of potential dangers.

Nanomedicine offers an innovative tool for combating the high rates of resistance that we are fighting nowadays, by the development of both alternative therapeutic and prophylaxis approaches and also novel diagnosis methods. Early detection of infectious diseases is the key to a successful treatment and the new developed applications based on nanotechnology offer an increased sensibility and efficiency of the diagnosis. The aim of this review is to reveal and discuss the main advances made on the science of nanomaterials for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases.

Although some microorganisms or their cytopathic effects may be clearly visible on routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, additional histochemical stains are often needed for their complete characterization. Highly specific molecular techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and nucleic acid amplification, may be needed in certain instances to establish the diagnosis of infection.

The HIV RNA was reverse transcribed and subjected to loop-mediated, isothermal amplification (LAMP). A detection limit of less than 10 HIV particles was demonstrated. The cassette is particularly suitable for resource poor regions, where funds and trained personnel are in short supply.

An astonishing diversity of coronaviruses was also discovered in different species of bats. For the recent and still ongoing avian influenza H5N1 outbreak that originated in Southeast Asia, from 2003 to 21 April 2006, 204 humans have been infected, with 113 deaths. Most patients had recent direct contacts with poultry.In Chinese wet-markets, unique epicenters for transmission of potential viral pathogens, new genes may be acquired or existing genes modified through various mechanisms such as genetic reassortment, recombination and mutation. The wet-markets, at closer proximity to humans, with high viral burden or strains of higher transmission efficiency, facilitate transmission of the viruses to humans.",

The success of such \"reactive\" strategies is influenced by the fraction of transmission occurring before signs appear. We performed experimental studies of foot-and-mouth disease transmission in cattle and estimated this fraction at less than half the value expected from detecting virus in body fluids, the standard proxy measure of infectiousness. This is because the infectious period is shorter (mean 1.7 days) than currently realized, and animals are not infectious until, on average, 0.5 days after clinical signs appear. These results imply that controversial preemptive control measures may be unnecessary; instead, efforts should be directed at early detection of infection and rapid intervention.",

    "abstract_text": "Climate change is adversely affecting the burden of infectious disease throughout the world, which is a health security threat. Climate-sensitive infectious disease includes vector-borne diseases such as malaria, whose transmission potential is expected to increase because of enhanced climatic suitability for the mosquito vector in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. Climatic suitability for the mosquitoes that can carry dengue, Zika, and chikungunya is also likely to increase, facilitating further increases in the geographic range and longer transmission seasons, and raising concern for expansion of these diseases into temperate zones, particularly under higher greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Early spring temperatures in 2018 seem to have contributed to the early onset and extensive West Nile virus outbreak in Europe, a pathogen expected to expand further beyond its current distribution, due to a warming climate. As for tick-borne diseases, climate change is projected to continue to contribute to the spread of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis, particularly in North America and Europe. Schistosomiasis is a water-borne disease and public health concern in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia; climate change is anticipated to change its distribution, with both expansions and contractions expected. Other water-borne diseases that cause diarrheal diseases have declined significantly over the last decades owing to socioeconomic development and public health measures but changes in climate can reverse some of these positive developments. Weather and climate events, population movement, land use changes, urbanization, global trade, and other drivers can catalyze a succession of secondary events that can lead to a range of health impacts, including infectious disease outbreaks. These cascading risk pathways of causally connected events can result in large-scale outbreaks and affect society at large.

Methods ASCO and IDSA convened an Update Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of relevant studies. The guideline recommendations were based on the review of evidence by the Expert Panel. Results Six new or updated meta-analyses and six new primary studies were added to the updated systematic review. Recommendation Clinical judgment is recommended when determining which patients are candidates for outpatient management, using clinical criteria or a validated tool such as the Multinational Association of Support Care in Cancer risk index. In addition, psychosocial and logistic considerations are outlined within the guideline. The panel continued to endorse consensus recommendations from the previous version of this guideline that patients with febrile neutropenia receive initial doses of empirical antibacterial therapy within 1 hour of triage and be monitored for \u2265 4 hours before discharge. An oral fluoroquinolone plus amoxicillin/clavulanate (or clindamycin, if penicillin allergic) is recommended as empirical outpatient therapy, unless fluoroquinolone prophylaxis was used before fever developed. Patients who do not defervesce after 2 to 3 days of an initial, empirical, broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen should be re-evaluated and considered as candidates for inpatient treatment.

    "abstract_text": "Automated digital contact tracing is effective and efficient, and one of the non-pharmaceutical complementary approaches to mitigate and manage epidemics like Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite the advantages of digital contact tracing, it is not widely used in the western world, including the US and Europe, due to strict privacy regulations and patient rights. We categorized the current approaches for contact tracing, namely: mobile service-provider-application, mobile network operators' call detail, citizen-application, and IoT-based. Current measures for infection control and tracing do not include animals and moving objects like cars despite evidence that these moving objects can be infection carriers. In this article, we designed and presented a novel privacy anonymous IoT model. We presented an RFID proof-of-concept for this model. Our model leverages blockchain's trust-oriented decentralization for on-chain data logging and retrieval. Our model solution will allow moving objects to receive or send notifications when they are close to a flagged, probable, or confirmed diseased case, or flagged place or object. We implemented and presented three prototype blockchain smart contracts for our model. We then simulated contract deployments and execution of functions. We presented the cost differentials. Our simulation results show less than one-second deployment and call time for smart contracts, though, in real life, it can be up to 25 seconds on Ethereum public blockchain. Our simulation results also show that it costs an average of $1.95 to deploy our prototype smart contracts, and an average of $0.34 to call our functions. Our model will make it easy to identify clusters of infection contacts and help deliver a notification for mass isolation while preserving individual privacy. Furthermore, it can be used to understand better human connectivity, model similar other infection spread network, and develop public policies to control the spread of COVID-19 while preparing for future epidemics.",

    "abstract_text": "Empiric quantification of human mobility patterns is paramount for better urban planning, understanding social network structure and responding to infectious disease threats, especially in light of rapid growth in urbanization and globalization. This need is of particular relevance for developing countries, since they host the majority of the global urban population and are disproportionally affected by the burden of disease. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) data-loggers to track the fine-scale (within city) mobility patterns of 582 residents from two neighborhoods from the city of Iquitos, Peru. We used \u223c2.3 million GPS data-points to quantify age-specific mobility parameters and dynamic co-location networks among all tracked individuals. Geographic space significantly affected human mobility, giving rise to highly local mobility kernels. Most (\u223c80%) movements occurred within 1 km of an individual's home. Potential hourly contacts among individuals were highly irregular and temporally unstructured. Only up to 38% of the tracked participants showed a regular and predictable mobility routine, a sharp contrast to the situation in the developed world. As a case study, we quantified the impact of spatially and temporally unstructured routines on the dynamics of transmission of an influenza-like pathogen within an Iquitos neighborhood. Temporally unstructured daily routines (e.g., not dominated by a single location, such as a workplace, where an individual repeatedly spent significant amount of time) increased an epidemic's final size and effective reproduction number by 20% in comparison to scenarios modeling temporally structured contacts. Our findings provide a mechanistic description of the basic rules that shape human mobility within a resource-poor urban center, and contribute to the understanding of the role of fine-scale patterns of individual movement and co-location in infectious disease dynamics. More generally, this study emphasizes the need for careful consideration of human social interactions when designing infectious disease mitigation strategies, particularly within resource-poor urban environments.",

The current investigation presents a comprehensive approach to assessing the spatial and temporal distributions of airborne infection risk in an aircraft cabin. A case of influenza outbreak was evaluated in a 4-h flight in a twin-aisle, fully occupied aircraft cabin with the index passenger seated at the center of the cabin. The approach considered the characteristics of the exhalation of the droplets carrying infectious agents from the index passenger, the dispersion of these droplets, and the inhalation of the droplets by susceptible passengers. Deterministic and probabilistic approaches were used to quantify the risks based on the amount of inhaled influenza virus RNA particles and quanta, respectively. The probabilistic approach indicated that the number of secondary infection cases can be reduced from 3 to 0 and 20 to 11, for influenza cases if N95 respirator masks are used by the passengers. The approach and methods developed can easily be implemented in other enclosed spaces such as buildings, trains, and buses to assess the infection risk. Practical Implications Airborne infectious disease transmission could take place in enclosed environments such as buildings and transport vehicles. The infection risk is difficult to estimate, and very few mitigation methods are available. This study used a 4-h flight as an example in analyzing the infection risk from influenza and in mitigating the risk with an N95 mask. The results will be useful to the airline industry in providing necessary protection to passengers and crew, and the results can also be used for other enclosed spaces.",

    "abstract_text": "Infectious diseases that affect their host on a long timescale can regulate the host population dynamics. Here we show that a strong Allee effect can lead to complex dynamics in simple epidemic models. Generally, the Allee effect renders a population bistable, but we also identify conditions for tri- or monostability. Moreover, the disease can destabilize endemic equilibria and induce sustained oscillations. These disappear again for high transmissibilities, with eventually vanishing host population. Disease-induced extinction is thus possible for density-dependent transmission and without any alternative reservoirs. The overall complexity suggests that the system is very sensitive to perturbations and control methods, even in parameter regions with a basic reproductive ratio far beyond R(0) = 1. This may have profound implications for biological conservation as well as pest management. We identify important threshold quantities and attribute the dynamical behavior to the joint interplay of a strong Allee effect and infection.",

Intravenous pretreatment of mice with glucan significantly enhanced the survival of mice challenged with either Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus or Rift Valley fever virus. Pretreatment was beneficial when initiated 3 days before challenge with VEE virus and 7 days before challenge with Rift Valley fever virus. Treatment of mice after VEE challenge did not increase their survival compared with controls. Glucan pretreatment of rats provided increased resistance to both intraperitoneal and low-dose aerosol challenges with virulent Francisella tularensis when the glucan was given intravenously, but not when it was administered intranasally. In contrast, intranasal glucan pretreatment enhanced the survival of mice when they were challenged by aerosol with Pseudomonas pseudomallei, whereas intravenous glucan pretreatment did not increase survival. mice given glucan combined with a marginally immunogenic dose of VEE vaccine were more resistant to homologous virus challenge than were mice given either Freund complete adjuvant plus vaccine or vaccine alone. Similarly, both primary and secondary VEE antibody titers in cynomolgus monkeys given glucan with VEE vaccine were significantly greater than titers in vaccine controls.",

    "abstract_text": "Accurate and reliable predictions of infectious disease dynamics can be valuable to public health organizations that plan interventions to decrease or prevent disease transmission. A great variety of models have been developed for this task, using different model structures, covariates, and targets for prediction. Experience has shown that the performance of these models varies; some tend to do better or worse in different seasons or at different points within a season. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to obtain a single prediction that leverages the strengths of each model. We considered a range of ensemble methods that each form a predictive density for a target of interest as a weighted sum of the predictive densities from component models. In the simplest case, equal weight is assigned to each component model; in the most complex case, the weights vary with the region, prediction target, week of the season when the predictions are made, a measure of component model uncertainty, and recent observations of disease incidence. We applied these methods to predict measures of influenza season timing and severity in the United States, both at the national and regional levels, using three component models. We trained the models on retrospective predictions from 14 seasons (1997/1998\u20132010/2011) and evaluated each model\u2019s prospective, out-of-sample performance in the five subsequent influenza seasons. In this test phase, the ensemble methods showed average performance that was similar to the best of the component models, but offered more consistent performance across seasons than the component models. Ensemble methods offer the potential to deliver more reliable predictions to public health decision makers.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary This paper uses the techniques of time series analysis (autocorrelation and spectral analysis) to examine oscillatory secular trends in the incidence of infectious diseases and the impact of mass vaccination programmes on these well-documented phenomena. We focus on three common childhood diseases: pertussis and mumps (using published disease-incidence data for England and Wales) and measles (using data from England and Wales, Scotland, North America and France). Our analysis indicates highly statistically significant seasonal and longer-term cycles in disease incidence in the prevaccination era. In general, the longer-term fluctuations (a 2-year period for measles, 3-year periods for pertussis and mumps) account for most of the cyclical variability in these data, particularly in the highly regular measles series for England and Wales. After vaccination, the periods of the longer-term oscillations tend to increase, an observation which corroborates theoretical predictions. Mass immunization against measles (which reduces epidemic fluctuations) magnifies the relative importance of the seasonal cycles. By contrast, we show that high levels of vaccination against whooping cough in England and Wales appear to have suppressed the annual cycle.",

    "title": "ORGAN DONOR SCREENING FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES",
    "abstract_text": "Medical suitability of organ donors is generally determined by evaluation of patient age, medical and social history, organ-specific function, and serologic testing for infectious disease. Given the impact of donor-transmitted infections upon the outcome of organ transplantation, detection of infection using serologic screening is an important measure of donor suitability. Although donor screening for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV*), human T-lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) type I, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and cytomegalovirus is routinely performed in the United States (Table 1)(1), there are no worldwide standards (2). The practices among organ procurement organizations (OPOs) vary widely, as do the interpretation and the reporting of the results (3). This review will summarize current knowledge about serologic donor screening for solid organ transplantation and discuss the utility of screening for organ donor suitability as well as the impact of latent donor infections upon recipient outcome. HIV INFECTION HIV has been transmitted from infected cadaver donors to multiple recipients of organs, resulting in the death of the allograft recipients(4). United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) policy states that organs from donors with a positive antibody screening to HIV are not suitable, unless subsequent confirmation testing indicates that the screening test was falsely positive. However, a confirmatory Western blot test cannot usually be performed emergently before the maximum time of cadaver organ preservation elapses. Therefore, for all practical purposes, a cadaver donor serum testing positive for HIV by the preliminary enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results in the discard of all donor organs for transplantation. In contrast, there is ample time to perform confirmatory testing upon living donors. All living organ donors should undergo voluntary screening for HIV, within 2-3 months before the planned transplant. During that interval, donors should be instructed to avoid societal encounters that might endanger an HIV exposure. For example, HIV has been transmitted from an asymptomatic living donor of a renal allograft (whose serology was HIV-negative 8 months before the transplant) following homosexual activity between the time of the HIV testing and the transplant (5). The American Red Cross is now screening blood and tissue donors for HIV p24 antigen (the core structural protein of the virus) by a Food and Drug Administration licensed method (6). This new test may be available for organ donor screening in the future. It enables HIV antigen detection within 30 days of exposure, in a window period when a patient may have viremia prior to the development of antibodies (7). The estimated average time between the p24 detection and the development of HIV antibody is approximately 7 days; thus, its temporal value may be limited. However, the importance of p24 antigen detection is underscored when the rare situation arises in which the organ donor is negative for HIV antibody by serology. Simonds et al. has reported the transmission of HIV to seven recipients of organs and tissues from a seronegative donor, who had HIV p24 antigen retrospectively identified in cultured spleen tissue(8). Presumably, p24 antigen would have been detected in a current peripheral blood sample. Five of the seven recipients (including the heart, liver, and kidney recipients) died with HIV infection. Because of the risk of HIV transmission to blood, tissue, and organ transplant recipients, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has developed guidelines for prevention of spreading HIV to organ and tissue recipients(Table 2)(9). The OPO staff should obtain a social history on all potential organ donors that addresses these criteria. When the social history of the potential donor reveals any of the CDC criteria, the risk of HIV transmission (despite negative serology screening) must be balanced against the benefit contemplated for a particular allograft recipient. Thus, organs may be recovered without restriction either for recipients with life-threatening illnesses (heart and liver) or for recipients of non-lifesaving transplants (lung, pancreas, kidney, bowel). In either circumstance, however, the CDC guidelines emphasize a requirement for the transplant center to inform recipients of the potential risk of donor HIV infection, even if that risk is presented only by the behavioral social history (10). Potential donors with a history of incarceration in a correctional institution should be assessed by the usual standards; however, a negative serology for HIV and hepatitis may be sufficient to permit unrestricted donation, if 6 consecutive months have elapsed since incarceration. Nevertheless, given the hazard of previous intravenous drug use in this population, some inmates may not be suitable donors because of positive serology screening. HTLV I INFECTION Although UNOS policy regarding HTLV I screening is the same as it is for HIV (organ donors are not suitable), not all OPOs reject a cadaver donor whose serology screening test reveals a positive anti-HTLV I(3). The risk of transmission of HTLV I by solid organ transplantation has not been clearly defined. HTLV has been transmitted to recipients of contaminated blood transfusions (11). However, depending upon the emergent nature and life-threatened status of a particular candidate for transplantation (especially heart or liver), a patient may have little alternative but to accept an organ from a donor whose screening for HTLV I is positive. There is also a possibility that the screening test is falsely positive. The social history may be helpful in discerning whether there is a likelihood of a true-positive result being subsequently determined by confirmatory testing. A patient infected with HTLV I by blood transfusion is at risk for the development of either adult T-cell leukemia or neurologic disorders(12). Thus, HTLV I is considered hazardous, and consistent with UNOS policy, many regard a positive donor screening for HTLV I to be an absolute contraindication to organ donation. HEPATITIS B INFECTION There are a several serologic profiles for potential organ donors who have been infected with hepatitis B. Furthermore, the implications of donor infectivity vary according to both the serologic profile and the organ to be donated. The following review is categorized by the possible hepatitis B results reported by an OPO to the transplant center. HEPATITIS B SURFACE ANTIGEN (HBsAg)-POSITIVE HBsAg may be identified in the serum of an infected patient within 30-60 days of exposure. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission has been documented to occur through organ transplantation (13, 14). Thus, detection of HBsAg in the donor blood sample indicates the donor is at risk for transmitting HBV. However, the OPO should verify the quality of the serum sample, as a false-positive result can arise from a hemolyzed sample of donor blood. Liver allografts from HBsAg-positive donors have been transplanted successfully to critically ill HBsAg-negative recipients in life-threatened clinical situations (15). Renal allografts transplanted from HBsAg-positive donors to HBsAg-negative recipients have also been performed without the development of HBV infection in the recipient; however, the satisfactory clinical course may have been influenced by the presence of previous immunization to HBV (16). Transplant physicians should recognize that there is a potential for a poor outcome when organs are transplanted from HBsAg-positive donors (deaths from HBV infection) even to HBsAg-positive recipients. When the HBsAg-positive result is verified by repeat testing of donor blood, organ procurement would likely be considered for heart recipients in a life-threatening emergency status, especially those candidates who are anti-HBs-positive (by virtue of immunization or natural immunity). ISOLATED ANTI-HBs-POSITIVE (HBsAg-NEGATIVE AND ANTI-HBc-NEGATIVE) This serologic profile of a donor blood sample could be observed after the vaccination of an individual with hepatitis B vaccine, after the administration of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), after the transfusion of a blood product from an immunized donor, or after previous HBV infection. Antibody to HBsAg, unlike antibody to the HBV core antigen (anti-HBc), does not arise during the acute infection but rather during convalescence. Thus, up to 6 months may elapse before anti-HBs may be detected following HBV infection. However, anti-HBc is usually detectable soon after exposure to the HBV, and it will usually persist (see below: the now well accepted importance of detecting anti-HBc). The donor with isolated anti-HBs is not likely to transmit HBV infection because there is no evidence of active viral replication. However, HBV DNA has been detected by the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the sera and liver of patients with idiopathic chronic liver disease, whose sera were HBsAg-negative and anti-HBs-positive (17). Moreover, the Mayo Clinic and University of California, San Francisco groups, in a joint report, have observed that a cadaver donor with a serology profile of HBsAg-negative, anti-HBs-positive, and anti-HBc-negative has transmitted HBV to a liver allograft recipient (18). They concluded that the sera from such donors may harbor HBV (as detected by PCR DNA analysis) despite the negative HBsAg. We should also note, however, that this circumstance seems to be rare (<1%). Therefore, a donor serology profile of isolated anti-HBs-positive does not seem to be a contraindication by itself to the recovery of all organs from such a donor, especially if the medical history of the donor reveals hepatitis B vaccination or the administration of HBIG. However, if no such medical history is determined, there is a rare possibility of HBV transmission from a cadaver donor to a liver allograft recipient with this serologic profile (18). ANTI-HBs-POSITIVE, ANTI-HBc-POSITIVE (HBsAg-NEGATIVE) Anti-HBc (IgM) is the earliest antibody detected following HBV infection(10-14 days). Anti-HBc (IgG) can persist for the lifetime of a previously infected patient. Although it has been generally accepted that a serologic profile of HBsAg-negative, anti-HBs-positive, and anti-HBc-positive reveals recovery and immunity to HBV infection, HBV may still reside in the donor patient's liver. Recent literature reports have emphasized the importance of anti-HBc detection regardless of the anti-HBs result(19, 20). Although the presence of the anti-HBs may suggest donor immunity to HBV, the detection of anti-HBs does not necessarily reduce the hazard of HBV transmission from donors who are anti-HBc-positive, especially among liver allograft recipients (21). It is now well established that HBV has been transmitted to liver allograft recipients from cadaver donors whose blood sample revealed a serologic profile of anti-HBc-positive and anti-HBs-positive (negative HBsAg)(22-25). The liver continues to harbor HBV (J. Hoofnagle, M.D., National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, personal communication, 1997), and following transplantation, HBV can replicate in the newly immunosuppressed environment. Dr. Hoofnagle and his colleagues have reviewed the Pittsburgh database of organ donors to determine the consequences of transplanting a liver allograft from an anti-HBc-positive donor to an HBsAg-negative recipient(19). There were 23 isolated anti-HBc-positive, HBsAg-negative donors from 982 HBsAg-negative donors. Some of these donors were anti-HBs-positive. During a mean follow-up of 3.2 years, 19/23 (83%) developed hepatitis B (none of the recipients was HBV+ prior to transplantation). Therefore, although donor anti-HBs-positive status may be associated with donor immunity to HBV, it does not necessarily protect the liver transplant recipient from transmission. Douglas et al. have recently reviewed the long-term experience with de novo HBV infection transmitted from an organ donor and have suggested that the clinical course may be relatively mild (26). It also seems that the risk of HBV transmission from isolated anti-HBc-positive donors is predominantly for the liver allograft recipient. This serologic profile may not carry the same risks for the recipients of extra-liver organs(20). In the University of California, San Francisco review, only 1 of 42 kidney and 0 of 7 heart allograft recipients became HBsAg-positive following transplantation of organs from isolated anti-HBc-positive donors, whereas 3 of 6 liver recipients became HBsAg-positive after transplantation from anti-HBc-positive donors. Mount Sinai Medical Center and the New York Regional Transplant Program have also recently analyzed the outcome of 52 HBsAg-negative recipients of allografts from 21 anti-HBc-positive donors. Although 4 of 16 liver allograft recipients became HBsAg-positive, none of the kidney nor heart recipient serologies became positive (27). ISOLATED ANTI-HBc-POSITIVE (HBsAg-NEGATIVE AND ANTI-HBs-NEGATIVE) A profile of isolated anti-HBc positivity may reflect the window of time in which anti-HBs has yet to be serologically detectable in an HBV-infected individual. An insufficient period has elapsed for the anti-HBs to become positive. Anti-HBc may be the only marker indicating current HBV infection, as the HBsAg has decreased in the peripheral blood to levels that are no longer detectable, and the anti-HBs has yet to increase in sufficient titer as to be detectable. The anti-HBc determination is not influenced by exposure to HBV vaccine. This serology profile is a potential concern for all allograft recipients. HBsAg-negative anti-HBcAb-positive donors can transmit HBV to renal allograft recipients, as noted recently by Satterthwaite et al.; thus, anti-HBc-positive donors must be considered cautiously (28). Miller and associates have proposed testing donor kidney tissue and serum for PCR analysis on HBsAg-negative anti-HBcAb-positive donors, further clarifying the risk of HBV transmission for renal allograft recipients(29). Donor liver functions are routinely performed to determine organ suitability, but these may be abnormal because of hemodynamic consequences. Therefore, a pretransplant liver biopsy should be performed on all anti-HBc-positive donors to examine for portal piecemeal necrosis consistent with active hepatitis (20). If the biopsy is positive for hepatitis, a true-positive anti-HBc is likely, and the risk of HBV transmission is high. Finally, there is an association of anti-HBc-positive donors with a serology positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV). A review of the serologic profiles of nearly 1000 New England Organ Bank donors has revealed 44 donors who had isolated anti-HBc, and 10 of 44 had concomitant HCV. Thus, the detection of HCV raises the suspicion that the anti-HBc-positive result is a true positive. We should also note that a false-positive anti-HBc result (by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method) may occur because of testing methodology in as many as 30% of the positive results (R. Dodd, Ph.D., American Red Cross, Rockville, MD, personal communication, 1997). Moreover, Turner has assessed the prevalence of anti-HBc positivity by screening the sera of 400 HBsAg-negative UK organ donors. Only 5 (25%) of the 20 sera in which anti-HBc was initially detected as positive by the Kodak Amerlite assay were confirmed as anti-HBc-positive with subsequent testing by radioimmunoassay (30). Therefore, false-positive rates of this magnitude require the need for additional studies to assess true positivity. Such studies could include either a positive anti-HBs or HCV serology result, a prerecovery liver biopsy (20), or the PCR analysis of donor kidney tissue (29). Some OPOs do not assay for anti-HBs in the routine serologic assessment of a prospective donor (C. Miller, M.D., Mount Sinai Hospital, NY, personal communication, 1997) and rely only on the anti-HBc determination. If the HBsAg is negative and the anti-HBc is negative, there are no restrictions to organ recovery. If the serologic donor profile reveals HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive, the anti-HBc-positive result is further defined by testing for IgM versus IgG. IgM-positive donor organs would not likely be recovered because the IgM-positive result indicates recent HBV exposure. However, IgG-positive donor organs may be recovered for life-threatened HBsAg-negative recipients or recipients who are HBsAg-positive. In either of the latter IgG-positive circumstances, Dr. Miller treats his recipients with prophylactic HBIG following transplantation (22). Nevertheless, it is our view that the determination of an anti-HBs result may be useful in deciding whether extrahepatic organs should be transplanted from a donor with a serology profile of HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc-positive. Although the detection of a positive anti-HBs suggests that an anti-HBc-positive result is likely to be a true positive, the positive anti-HBs determination may indicate that the risk of HBV transmission to extrahepatic recipients is very minimal. Caldwell has recently commented upon the implications of detecting an anti-HBc-positive serology in an organ donor (31). Posttransplantation HBIG was effective in averting allograft-transmitted HBV infection from an anti-HBc-positive donor for a patient who required a transplant because of HBV infection. Lamivudine therapy has also been administered successfully to patients with de novo HBV infection following transplantation (31). Finally, the presence of anti-HBs in the potential allograft recipient(e.g., following the previous administration of HBV vaccination) may also be an important consideration. The risk of HBV infection by transplantation of a liver allograft from a donor who is anti-HBc-positive is reduced for recipients who have preexisting anti-HBs (J. Fung, M.D., University of Pittsburgh, PA, personal communication, 1997). Table 3 presents a summary of the risks related to the transmission of HBV infection by results of the donor serology testing and recommendations regarding suitability for transplantation. HEPATITIS C VIRUS The hazard of HCV transmission from a previously infected organ donor is a concern for all allograft recipients. Approximately 5% of all organ donors are anti-HCV-positive (32). The presence of anti-HCV antibody is indicative of an HCV infection, as anti-HCV antibody appears in a peripheral blood sample within 2 months of HCV exposure. Most OPOs have adopted a policy of screening organ donors for anti-HCV antibody(3). Currently, all organ donors should be tested for anti-HCV antibody using a second-generation enzyme immunoassay that has increased sensitivity and specificity compared with earlier assays(33). The antibody to HCV does not represent protection of donor organ contamination; however, it is also important to emphasize that detecting anti-HCV in the donor serology panel is not predictive of HCV transmission (33). Approximately 50% of anti-HCV-positive patients have detectable hepatitis C viremia by PCR analysis of a peripheral blood specimen(32). All PCR-positive organ donors will transmit HCV to allograft recipients (32); however, the risk of HCV transmission from a PCR-negative (anti-HCV antibody-positive) donor is unclear(34). Unfortunately, the use of PCR testing (or branched chain DNA testing) cannot be accomplished within the time constraint of the preservation period necessary for the release of the donor organs. Thus, exclusion of all anti-HCV-positive organ donors would eliminate the possibility of HCV transmission; however, such an indiscriminate policy would unnecessarily discard some organs that are not infected with HCV(Table 4). The consequence of receiving an organ from a donor who is anti-HCV-positive is as follows: approximately 50% of the recipients have detectable anti-HCV antibody; 24% have detectable hepatitis C viremia by the PCR analysis; and 35% may develop liver disease (32). However, notwithstanding the high risk of transmission of HCV to allograft recipients (35), a positive screening result does not necessarily rule out organ donation (34). Transplanting an HCV-positive heart allograft when the recipient's life is endangered is an accepted practice even though the recipient is HCV-negative(Table 5)(36, 37). Otherwise, a general restriction of transplanting organs from an HCV-positive donor has been controversial (38). Because the treatment of HCV infection in an immunosuppressed allograft recipient is usually not successful(34), many centers regard a positive donor serology for HCV as a contraindication to transplantation. Fishman et al. have suggested a selective strategy of reserving organs from HCV-positive donors for recipients with a previous HCV exposure and detectable anti-HCV antibody(34). There is evidence in both animal models and human studies that \u201csuperinfection\u201d with donor strains can occur in HCV-positive recipients (39, 40), so this approach is not without risk. However, liver transplantation from an anti-HCV-positive donor to an anti-HCV-positive recipient does not seem to cause an increased morbidity or mortality (41). Furthermore, the kidneys from an anti-HCV-positive donor could also be targeted for those who are sensitized, diabetic, or elderly and thus may have a limited opportunity for a successful transplant or a relatively limited lifespan(34). This approach seems to be prudent, as the long-term risk of chronic hepatitis in renal transplant recipients has now been well documented (42, 43). CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) The seminal work of Ho et al. (44) established the cadaveric organ donor as a most important source of CMV infection in the organ recipient. Thus, all prospective organ donors and recipients should be routinely tested for antibody to CMV. The presence of antibody in either the donor or the recipient indicates the presence of latent viral infection. The specific CMV donor and recipient serologic status has implications for prophylaxis, the highest risk group being CMV-seronegative recipients of CMV-seropositive donor organs (i.e., the so-called primary infection group). Transplantation of an organ from a CMV-positive donor results in subsequent reactivation of the latent virus and replication of the immunosuppressed host. In addition, there is molecular evidence that superinfection from the donor strain can occur in CMV-seropositive recipients (45). However, recent evidence suggests that donor CMV-positive/recipient-negative mismatches can be successfully overcome by strategies aimed at CMV prophylaxis(46). Historically, several studies in kidney, liver, and lung transplantation demonstrated decreased survival among recipients of CMV-seropositive organs(47, 48). Centers performing small bowel transplantation have chosen to restrict CMV-seropositive donors from CMV-seronegative recipients because of high morbidity and mortality(49). The development of CMV disease has been associated with increased morbidity and cost associated with transplantation(50) as well as opportunistic infection(51). Recipient CMV infection is associated with an increased risk of organ rejection, allograft loss, and death(47, 52, 53). Nevertheless, data from many of these studies predate more effective prophylactic strategies in the control of CMV infection or disease (54). The laboratory techniques used for CMV serologic testing of donors include enzyme immunoassay and latex agglutination. These techniques have been developed primarily for blood donor screening and, as a result, are very sensitive and generally may err toward classifying patients or donors as falsely positive. It is our personal experience that false-positive results may occur in about 10-15% of cadaveric donors. However, from a prevention view point, this may be acceptable because one would not want to misclassify a positive donor as CMV-seronegative. The transplantation of CMV-seropositive donor organs has not been considered an absolute contraindication to transplantation despite the increased risks cited earlier. This is especially pertinent for potential living organ donors (55). The primary reason for allowing such organs to be transplanted has been the high seroprevalence of the virus in the general population. The prevalence among both organ donors and recipients varies from 40% to 80% depending on age, socioeconomic status, and geographic distribution. Fortunately, better control of CMV with refinements in immunosuppression, and the development of effective antiviral agents, has improved the outcome for patients receiving organs from CMV-seropositive donors. From a practical standpoint, donor testing for CMV should always be performed before any blood or plasma product transfusion to an organ donor. This clearly establishes the risk of CMV transmission specifically from the organ donor. Testing of organ donors after blood transfusion presents an additional complexity of assessing the risk of CMV transmission in the blood products given to the donor, even though this risk would be very small(currently <1% risk of an organ donor acquiring CMV from blood product transfusion). Furthermore, testing after donor transfusion also introduces the possibility of a false-positive organ donor CMV result because of anti-CMV antibody passively transmitted in the blood products. Use of CMV IgM antibody assays in addition to IgG antibody assays has been advocated by some OPOs. However, it is our experience that IgM anti-CMV is not present in the absence of IgG antibody(56-58). Furthermore, the IgM assay lacks sensitivity; it is not as standardized as the IgG assays that are available and false-positive results are not uncommon(56-58). Therefore, from a practical perspective, we would not recommend their use as there is no additional information gained by screening for IgM antibody to CMV. TREPONEMAL ANTIGEN (SYPHILIS) The detection of antibody to syphilis by the rapid plasma reagin test (RPR) is not a contraindication to organ procurement (59), but it is a contraindication to tissue procurement. The RPR is reactive in >90% of patients with primary syphilis, but it may be negative between 6 and 18 months after primary infection. Although syphilis can be transmitted by blood transfusion (60), we are unaware of a recorded infection of a transplant recipient from a syphilitic donor. Moreover, a standard course of penicillin would provide sufficient antibiotic coverage to prevent syphilitic complications in an allograft recipient (37). This regimen has been reportedly successful in the treatment of two renal allograft recipients intentionally given kidneys from an organ donor whose serology tests for syphilis were positive (60). Thus, a recipient of any RPR-positive organ donor should be treated for 15 days with penicillin or, for those who are penicillin allergic, doxycycline, tetracycline, or erythromycin. TOXOPLASMA The possible transmission of the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii is a concern especially for heart allograft recipients because of the predilection of this parasite for muscle tissue (61). Organ procurement from seropositive donors is not contraindicated; however, the detection of seropositivity means that the recipient may be placed at high risk. Fortunately, the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole forPneumocystis carinii prophylaxis prevents transmission of T gondii(62). OTHER VIRUSES The transmission of neurotropic viruses such as rabies and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease have been reported from tissue donors(63). Thus, organ donor deaths associated with these diagnoses exclude donation. Although successful transplantation of renal allografts from donors with Reye's syndrome (encephalopathy and liver failure) has been reported (64, 65), some transplant centers may be reluctant to expose their recipient to an unknown (presumed viral) etiology of donor death. Over 95% of potential adult donors are seropositive for Epstein-Barr virus(EBV) (IgG antibody); thus, serological screening of organ donors for EBV has not been routinely performed. However, primary EBV infection, i.e., transplantation of an organ from an EBV-seropositive donor to an EBV-seronegative recipient, is associated with an increased risk of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. Therefore, recognition of this mismatch in a potential allograft recipient known to be EBV-negative may have important prognostic information. Currently, there is no effective means of preventing this complication. BACTERIOLOGY AND DONOR SEPSIS From an organ bank perspective, sepsis at the time of a patient's death introduces the risk of transmitting infectious disease by donor organs contaminated with bacteria (37). However, OPOs now routinely evaluate donor infection on an individual basis, considering the blood culture bacteriology, the presence and duration of central lines, and the nature of the donor infection, before excluding a patient as an organ donor. The risk of bacteremia may be influenced by an extremity cellulitis(especially adjacent to external orthopedic fixatives) or a current intestinal injury or surgery. However, none of these conditions alone prohibits organ donation. Patients with bacterial meningitis may also be acceptable for organ donation. Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis are the most common bacterial pathogens(66). The administration of at least a broad spectrum cephalosporin to a potential donor is indicated under these circumstances(66). However, other bacterial organisms carry a more significant hazard for blood vessel disruption following transplantation. For example,Staphylococcus aureus(67),Bacteroides species (59), Klebsiella enterobacter(68), Escherichia coli(68), Pseudomonas aeruginosa(69), and fungal infections such as Candida albicans(37, 70, 71), Cryptococcus neoformans(37), and Histoplasma capsulatum(59) have been transmitted to allograft recipients from infected donors or infected preservation fluids and implicated in the formation of recipient mycotic aneursyms and disruption of their allograft anastomoses. In the case of bacteremia, if a sufficient course of antibiotic therapy has been administered that minimizes the risk of bacterial transmission, then organ donation may be considered (72). Lung recovery may still be accomplished when the donor has a unilateral pneumonia. In contrast, fungal contamination is very worrisome because the opportunity for adequate donor treatment is limited. Because Candida infections are particularly hazardous to the pancreas transplant recipient(73), many transplant surgeons administer amphotericin B through the nasogastric tube into the donor duodenum during the recovery procedure. RESPONSE REGARDING POSITIVE SEROLOGY TESTING OF DONORS When serology screening reveals a positive test, confirmatory testing may be subsequently performed by independent laboratories for each pathogen(including Treponema). The practice of the New England Organ Bank is to report the confirmed positive findings to the family member who gave consent for donation, if there is a hazard that the donor might have transmitted infection to that family member (contact with bodily fluids). This process assures that any family member would be appropriately cared for, who is potentially at risk of exposure to HBsAg, HCV, HIV, HTLV, or syphilis. Otherwise, such notification would not apply to estranged family or guardians who consent to donation.",

    "abstract_text": "The American Thoracic Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Infectious Diseases Society of America jointly sponsored the development of this guideline for the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis, which is also endorsed by the European Respiratory Society and the US National Tuberculosis Controllers Association. Representatives from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Canadian Thoracic Society, the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, and the World Health Organization also participated in the development of the guideline. This guideline provides recommendations on the clinical and public health management of tuberculosis in children and adults in settings in which mycobacterial cultures, molecular and phenotypic drug susceptibility tests, and radiographic studies, among other diagnostic tools, are available on a routine basis. For all recommendations, literature reviews were performed, followed by discussion by an expert committee according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. Given the public health implications of prompt diagnosis and effective management of tuberculosis, empiric multidrug treatment is initiated in almost all situations in which active tuberculosis is suspected. Additional characteristics such as presence of comorbidities, severity of disease, and response to treatment influence management decisions. Specific recommendations on the use of case management strategies (including directly observed therapy), regimen and dosing selection in adults and children (daily vs intermittent), treatment of tuberculosis in the presence of HIV infection (duration of tuberculosis treatment and timing of initiation of antiretroviral therapy), as well as treatment of extrapulmonary disease (central nervous system, pericardial among other sites) are provided. The development of more potent and better-tolerated drug regimens, optimization of drug exposure for the component drugs, optimal management of tuberculosis in special populations, identification of accurate biomarkers of treatment effect, and the assessment of new strategies for implementing regimens in the field remain key priority areas for research. See the full-text online version of the document for detailed discussion of the management of tuberculosis and recommendations for practice.",

    "abstract_text": "The incidence of acute episodes of intestinal infectious diseases in the United States was estimated through analysis of community-based studies and national interview surveys. Their differing results were reconciled by adjusting the study population age distributions in the community-based studies, by excluding those cases that also showed respiratory symptoms, and by accounting for structural differences in the surveys. The reconciliation process provided an estimate of 99 million acute cases of either vomiting or diarrhea, or both, each year in this country, half of which involved more than a full day of restricted activity. The analysis was limited to cases of acute gastrointestinal diseases with vomiting or diarrhea but without respiratory symptoms. Physicians were consulted for 8.2 million illnesses; 250,000 of these required hospitalization. In 1985, hospitalizations incurred $560 million in medical costs and $200 million in lost productivity. Nonhospitalized cases (7.9 million) for which physicians were consulted incurred $690 million in medical costs and $2.06 billion in lost productivity. More than 90 million cases for which no physician was consulted cost an estimated $19.5 billion in lost productivity. The estimates excluded such costs as death, pain and suffering, lost leisure time, financial losses to food establishments, and legal expenses. According to these estimates, medical costs and lost productivity from acute intestinal infectious diseases amount to a minimum of about $23 billion a year in the United States.",
