This is a proposed novelty feature for preprints using a RAG based approach. We hope to boost promising preprints on our backend to streamline the 
peer review process.
You must create your own key from openAI to properly use this software, within GPT_engine/engine.py you should put this key.
Furthermore, this software currently pulls from an Airtable of preprints, that code can be replaced whatever technique of feeding preprints to the engine that you would prefer.
